I have all the documentation I need. Let me provide you with comprehensive answers to your five research questions about Claude Code hooks for your memory system design.\n\n## Hook Research Summary for Memory System Design\n\n### 1. **SessionEnd Hook: Reliability and Behavior**\n\n**Reliability**: SessionEnd hooks are reliable and always fire when a session ends.\n\n**Timing**: From the documentation, SessionEnd fires when a Claude Code session ends. The `reason` field indicates why:\n- `clear` - Session cleared with `/clear` command\n- `logout` - User logged out\n- `prompt_input_exit` - User exited while prompt input was visible\n- `other` - Other exit reasons\n\n**Compaction behavior**: **Important caveat**: SessionEnd does NOT trigger on compaction/summarization. The `reason` field shows that compaction is handled separately via `PreCompact` hooks (which run *before* compaction), not SessionEnd. This is a critical distinction for your memory system.\n\n**For your use case**: SessionEnd is reliable for capturing final session state, but you may also want to consider `PreCompact` hooks if you need to save learnings before the context is summarized.\n\n---\n\n### 2. **Available Data to Hooks**\n\n**Common fields available to all hooks** (via stdin as JSON):\n```json\n{\n  \"session_id\": \"string\",           // YES - session ID is available\n  \"transcript_path\": \"string\",      // YES - full path to conversation JSON\n  \"cwd\": \"string\",                  // Current working directory\n  \"permission_mode\": \"string\"       // \"default\", \"plan\", \"acceptEdits\", or \"bypassPermissions\"\n}\n```\n\n**SessionEnd hook specifically receives**:\n```json\n{\n  \"session_id\": \"abc123\",\n  \"transcript_path\": \"~/.claude/projects/.../00893aaf-19fa-41d2-8238-13269b9b3ca0.jsonl\",\n  \"cwd\": \"/Users/...\",\n  \"permission_mode\": \"default\",\n  \"hook_event_name\": \"SessionEnd\",\n  \"reason\": \"exit\"\n}\n```\n\n**Excellent news for your design**:\n- You have `session_id` ✓\n- You have `transcript_path` (the full path to the session transcript) ✓\n- You can read the transcript file directly using the path\n- Environment variables are available, including `CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR` for project-specific storage\n\n**No additional parameters** are passed; you work with the JSON structure above and environment variables.\n\n---\n\n### 3. **User Prompting Capabilities**\n\n**Direct prompting in SessionEnd hooks: NO**\n\nHooks cannot directly prompt users. However, you have **three alternatives**:\n\n**Alternative 1: Notifications (Limited)**\n- Use `Notification` hook to alert users, but this is one-way (no response capture)\n- Limited use for a memory system that needs user input\n\n**Alternative 2: Stop Hook (Recommended for some flows)**\n- Stop hook can block Claude from finishing and prompt for input via hook output\n- Can display `systemMessage` to the user\n- Could work for intermediate session reviews, but **not ideal for post-session flows**\n\n**Alternative 3: User-Invoked Command (Best for your use case)**\n- Create a slash command or skill that users explicitly invoke\n- Allows two-way interaction: ask questions, get responses\n- Best approach: SessionEnd hook *logs* session state, then a separate `/save-learning` command handles the interactive part\n- This gives you the \"yankable\" (revocable) design you want in your CLAUDE.md\n\n**Recommendation for alignment-hive**: Combine:\n1. **SessionEnd hook** - Automatically logs transcript to temporary staging\n2. **User command** (e.g., `/save-learning`) - User reviews and confirms what to save to persistent storage\n3. This gives you automatic capture + human review + consent model\n\n---\n\n### 4. **Hook Timeouts**\n\n**Default timeout**: 60 seconds per hook\n\n**Configuration**: Timeouts are configurable per-hook with `\"timeout\"` field (in seconds):\n```json\n{\n  \"type\": \"command\",\n  \"command\": \"your-command\",\n  \"timeout\": 30\n}\n```\n\n**Is 60 seconds enough for network upload?** \n- **Yes, 60 seconds is reasonable** for uploading session transcripts (typically a few KB to a few MB)\n- Stytch + Convex (your Session 1 architecture) endpoints are fast\n- BUT: You could extend to 90-120 seconds for reliability, especially if uploading to R2 (CDN uploads can be slower)\n- **Recommendation**: Set `\"timeout\": 120` for your SessionEnd upload hook to be safe\n\n---\n\n### 5. **Other Relevant Hooks for Memory Capture**\n\nBeyond SessionEnd, here are hooks useful for capturing session learnings:\n\n| Hook | When It Fires | Use for Memory System |\n|------|---------------|----------------------|\n| **SessionEnd** | Session ends | Primary hook - save final state, upload transcript |\n| **PreCompact** | Before context summarization (manual or auto) | Capture learnings before summarization loses details; save pre-compact state |\n| **Stop** | After Claude finishes responding | Could block and prompt for session notes |\n| **SubagentStop** | After subagent finishes | Track subagent learnings separately |\n| **PostToolUse** | After tool execution | Log tool usage patterns for learning |\n| **UserPromptSubmit** | Before processing user prompt | Could add retrieved memory context |\n\n**Most relevant for memory system**:\n\n1. **SessionEnd** (primary) - Automatic capture when session closes\n2. **PreCompact** (secondary) - Capture details before they're lost to summarization\n3. **SessionStart** (future enhancement) - Load retrieved memories at session start\n4. **Stop** (optional) - Could offer session review, but SessionEnd + user command is cleaner\n\n**Execution Detail**: All matching hooks run **in parallel** if multiple match, with **deduplication** of identical hooks.\n\n---\n\n## Recommendations for alignment-hive Memory System\n\nBased on this research:\n\n1. **Use SessionEnd hook** as your primary capture point:\n   - Reliable trigger\n   - Has session_id and transcript_path\n   - 120-second timeout for network upload\n   - Automatically invoked\n\n2. **Separate user consent** from automatic capture:\n   - Hook automatically saves to temporary staging (not permanent)\n   - Create `/save-learning` command for user to review + approve\n   - Implements your \"human review required\" and \"yankable\" principles from CLAUDE.md\n\n3. **Add PreCompact hook** for context-aware learning:\n   - Saves pre-summarization state when auto-compact triggers\n   - Preserves rich detail that might be lost\n\n4. **Future: SessionStart hook** for memory injection:\n   - Will be useful in future sessions to load relevant memories\n   - Part of your learning system architecture\n\n5. **Storage pattern** (for your Convex + Stytch design from Session 1):\n   - SessionEnd hook → POST to memory staging endpoint\n   - /save-learning command → Review transcript, call approval endpoint\n   - R2 can store actual transcript blobs (referenced by session_id)\n\nThis separates the *deterministic capture* (SessionEnd hook) from the *interactive review* (user command), giving you the best of both worlds: automatic recording + human agency."},{"type":"text","text":"agentId: ad114d8 (for resuming to continue this agent's work if needed)"}]}]},"isSidechain":false}

Now I have comprehensive information. Let me compile this into a detailed response for your memory system research.\n\n## Comprehensive Claude Code Hooks Research\n\nI've gathered detailed information from the official Claude Code documentation. Here are your answers:\n\n### 1. SessionEnd Hook Reliability\n\n**Does it trigger reliably?**\nSessionEnd hooks are **reliable for clean session termination**. They fire when sessions end normally (via `/exit` or Ctrl+D), but documentation notes potential limitations for crash scenarios. Here's what the docs specify:\n\n**SessionEnd Hook Input Schema:**\n```json\n{\n  \"session_id\": \"abc123\",\n  \"transcript_path\": \"~/.claude/projects/.../00893aaf-19fa-41d2-8238-13269b9b3ca0.jsonl\",\n  \"cwd\": \"/Users/...\",\n  \"permission_mode\": \"default\",\n  \"hook_event_name\": \"SessionEnd\",\n  \"reason\": \"exit\"\n}\n```\n\n**Behavior on compaction:**\nSessionEnd does NOT trigger on compaction operations (manual `/compact` or auto-compact). Instead, compaction triggers the `PreCompact` hook before the operation. SessionEnd only fires when the actual session process terminates.\n\n**Trigger events:**\n- TRIGGERS: Clean session exit (`/exit` command, Ctrl+D, normal termination)\n- DOES NOT TRIGGER: Compaction operations, session resumption (SessionStart fires instead)\n- The `reason` field indicates exit type: `\"exit\"`, `\"clear\"`, `\"logout\"`, `\"prompt_input_exit\"`, or `\"other\"`\n\n**Reliability caveat:** Per the official documentation and GitHub issues, SessionEnd is guaranteed for clean termination but lacks coverage for crash/unexpected shutdown scenarios. This was a design tradeoff documented in [Issue #6306](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code/issues/6306).\n\n---\n\n### 2. Environment Variables in Hooks\n\n**Available environment variables:**\n\nAll hooks receive these common fields via **stdin as JSON** (not environment variables):\n\n```json\n{\n  \"session_id\": \"abc123\",\n  \"transcript_path\": \"/Users/.../.claude/projects/.../00893aaf-19fa-41d2-8238-13269b9b3ca0.jsonl\",\n  \"cwd\": \"/Users/...\",\n  \"permission_mode\": \"default\",\n  \"hook_event_name\": \"SessionEnd\"\n}\n```\n\n**For actual environment variables** that Claude Code provides:\n\n- `CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR` - Absolute path to project root (available to all hooks)\n- `CLAUDE_CODE_REMOTE` - Set to `\"true\"` in web environment, empty/unset in CLI\n- `CLAUDE_ENV_FILE` - **Only available to SessionStart hooks** - path to a file where you can persist environment variables for subsequent bash commands\n\n**Critical point:** There is **no pre-parsed environment variable for session_id** - you must parse stdin JSON to access it. The transcript file path is provided directly in the JSON payload, making it accessible to any hook.\n\n**Accessing session data from hooks:**\n```bash\n#!/bin/bash\n# Read JSON from stdin\nsession_info=$(cat)\nsession_id=$(echo \"$session_info\" | jq -r '.session_id')\ntranscript_path=$(echo \"$session_info\" | jq -r '.transcript_path')\n```\n\nThe transcript is stored as JSONL (JSON Lines format), so each line is a separate JSON object representing one turn in the conversation.\n\n---\n\n### 3. User Prompting from Hooks\n\n**Direct user input from hooks?** NO - hooks cannot directly prompt users. \n\n**Available alternatives:**\n\n1. **Notification Hook** - Can trigger desktop notifications but cannot wait for response:\n   ```json\n   {\n     \"hooks\": {\n       \"Notification\": [\n         {\n           \"matcher\": \"permission_prompt\",\n           \"hooks\": [{\"type\": \"command\", \"command\": \"notify-send 'Claude' 'Action needed'\"}]\n         }\n       ]\n     }\n   }\n   ```\n\n2. **Stop Hook** - Can block session continuation and force Claude to wait for user action:\n   - Exit code 2 with stderr message shows error to Claude\n   - Claude must then respond to the error (effectively pausing)\n   - Does NOT directly prompt the user\n\n3. **UserPromptSubmit Hook** - Can add context to user prompts or block prompts entirely:\n   - Can inject context via stdout or JSON `additionalContext` field\n   - Cannot wait for user response mid-hook\n\n4. **Prompt-based hooks** (Stop/SubagentStop only) - Can use LLM to make intelligent blocking decisions with custom messages\n\n**Feature gap:** There is an open feature request [Issue #10168](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code/issues/10168) for a `UserInputRequired` hook that would trigger when Claude pauses waiting for user input. This doesn't yet exist.\n\n**For your memory system:** You'd likely want a SessionEnd hook that archives the transcript, then either:\n- Use a notification to alert the user after the hook completes\n- Have the hook add context via a file that triggers next session's SessionStart hook\n- Store session metadata in a dedicated location and let users query it via slash command\n\n---\n\n### 4. Hook Timeouts\n\n**Default timeout:** 60 seconds (configurable per hook)\n\n**Configuration:**\n```json\n{\n  \"hooks\": {\n    \"PostToolUse\": [\n      {\n        \"matcher\": \"Write\",\n        \"hooks\": [\n          {\n            \"type\": \"command\",\n            \"command\": \"your-command\",\n            \"timeout\": 30\n          }\n        ]\n      }\n    ]\n  }\n}\n```\n\n**Timeout specifications:**\n- **Command hooks** (`type: \"command\"`): Default 60 seconds, configurable per hook via `\"timeout\"` field (in seconds)\n- **Prompt-based hooks** (`type: \"prompt\"`): Default 30 seconds, also configurable\n- Each command hook's timeout is independent (one timeout doesn't affect others)\n\n**Important:** The 60-second default was not configurable until version 1.0.85+. Long-running validations (like E2E tests) require explicit timeout configuration. There's no global timeout setting - configure per hook.\n\n---\n\n### 5. Stop Hook vs SessionEnd Hook\n\n**Stop Hook:**\n- **When it triggers:** After the main Claude Code agent finishes responding\n- **Frequency:** Multiple times per session (after each agent response)\n- **Blocking capability:** Yes - can block session continuation with exit code 2\n- **Reliability:** Fires consistently at turn completion, but NOT guaranteed to fire on crashes\n- **Input:** `stop_hook_active` boolean (true if already continuing from previous Stop hook)\n- **Use case:** Per-response quality gates, validation, per-turn cleanup\n\n```json\n{\n  \"session_id\": \"abc123\",\n  \"transcript_path\": \"~/.claude/projects/.../transcript.jsonl\",\n  \"hook_event_name\": \"Stop\",\n  \"stop_hook_active\": false\n}\n```\n\n**SessionEnd Hook:**\n- **When it triggers:** When the entire session terminates (clean exit only)\n- **Frequency:** Once per session\n- **Blocking capability:** No - cannot prevent session end, only cleanup\n- **Reliability:** Guaranteed for clean termination, NOT for crashes\n- **Input:** `reason` field indicating exit type\n- **Use case:** Session cleanup, transcript archival, final metrics logging\n\n```json\n{\n  \"session_id\": \"abc123\",\n  \"transcript_path\": \"~/.claude/projects/.../transcript.jsonl\",\n  \"hook_event_name\": \"SessionEnd\",\n  \"reason\": \"exit\"\n}\n```\n\n**Key differences:**\n\n| Aspect | Stop | SessionEnd |\n|--------|------|-----------|\n| Fires per | Response | Session |\n| Can block | Yes (exit code 2) | No |\n| Transcript complete | Partial (current turn) | Complete |\n| Crash safe | No | No |\n| Use for validation | Yes | No |\n| Use for cleanup | No | Yes |\n\n---\n\n### Important Caveats for Your Memory System\n\nBased on the official documentation and open issues:\n\n1. **SessionEnd reliability gap:** For production use, consider pairing SessionEnd hooks with an external wrapper script that monitors the process, since crashes won't trigger the hook\n\n2. **Compaction behavior:** SessionEnd doesn't fire during compaction - if you need to archive transcripts on compaction, use PreCompact hook instead\n\n3. **No real-time user prompting:** SessionEnd can't ask users for confirmation. You'll need alternative UX patterns (notifications + subsequent SessionStart context injection)\n\n4. **Transcript access:** The `transcript_path` points to a JSONL file. Each line is valid JSON representing one message/tool call in the conversation\n\n5. **30-second vs 60-second timeout:** If your memory system needs to do significant work (calling APIs, writing to S3, database operations), configure explicit timeout values to avoid getting killed mid-operation\n\n---\n\n**Official References:**\n\n- [Hooks reference documentation](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/hooks.md)\n- [Hooks quickstart guide](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/hooks-guide.md)\n- [GitHub Issue #6306: Document the SessionEnd Hook](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code/issues/6306)\n- [GitHub Issue #4649: Gratitude for SessionStart & Feature Request for SessionEnd](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code/issues/4649)\n\nThis should give you everything you need for architecting the memory system. Would you like me to help design the specific hook implementations for your Stytch + Convex + R2 storage architecture?"},{"type":"text","text":"agentId: a127579 (for resuming to continue this agent's work if needed)"}]}]},"isSidechain":false}

The conversation is summarized below:\nAnalysis:\nLet me chronologically analyze the conversation:\n\n1. **Initial Request**: User wants to continue working on a memory system, specifically Session 2 which is about \"Hook Behavior & User Prompting\". They want to approach this rigorously and test everything.\n\n2. **Context Gathering**: I read:\n   - `/Users/yoav/projects/alignment-hive/docs/memory-system-plan.md` - The main planning document showing the architecture for MATS researchers to contribute session learnings\n   - `/Users/yoav/projects/alignment-hive/docs/sessions/session-1-privacy-storage.md` - Previous session notes about storage decisions (R2, Stytch, Convex)\n\n3. **Session 2 Open Questions Identified**:\n   - Does SessionEnd hook trigger reliably? On compaction?\n   - Access to session_id and transcript_path?\n   - Can hooks prompt for user input?\n   - Hook timeout (60s default) - enough for uploads?\n\n4. **Research Phase**: Used claude-code-guide subagent to research hook documentation. Key findings:\n   - SessionEnd triggers on clean exit only, NOT crashes or compaction\n   - session_id and transcript_path available via stdin JSON (not env vars)\n   - Hooks cannot directly prompt users\n   - 60s default timeout, configurable per hook\n\n5. **Test Hook Creation**:\n   - Created `/Users/yoav/projects/alignment-hive/test-hooks/` directory\n   - Initially created separate log scripts (log-session-end.sh, log-session-start.sh, log-stop.sh)\n   - Later consolidated to single `log-all-events.sh`\n\n6. **Settings Configuration Error**: When configuring hooks in settings.local.json, I made an error with the schema. The hook structure requires a nested `hooks` array, not a direct command object.\n\n7. **User Feedback**: \n   - User noted hooks need restart to load\n   - User wants to test edge cases (kill signals, compaction, etc.)\n   - User wants state tracking/recovery consideration\n   - User asked to clean up unused scripts\n\n8. **Cleanup**: Removed the individual log scripts, kept only `log-all-events.sh`\n\n9. **Final State**: User ran /exit twice (session ended)\n\nSummary:\n1. Primary Request and Intent:\n   The user wants to continue developing a memory system for MATS researchers, specifically working on Session 2: \"Hook Behavior & User Prompting\". The goal is to rigorously test Claude Code hooks (SessionStart, Stop, SessionEnd, PreCompact) to understand their behavior for capturing session transcripts. Key questions: when do hooks fire, what data do they receive, and how to handle edge cases like crashes.\n\n2. Key Technical Concepts:\n   - Claude Code hooks (SessionStart, SessionEnd, Stop, PreCompact)\n   - Hook input via stdin as JSON (not environment variables)\n   - Hook schema structure: requires nested `hooks` array with `type` and `command`\n   - session_id and transcript_path provided in hook input\n   - SessionEnd only fires on clean exit, NOT on crashes or compaction\n   - PreCompact hook fires during compaction instead of SessionEnd\n   - 60-second default hook timeout (configurable)\n   - Hooks cannot prompt users directly\n   - Memory system architecture: Stytch auth → Convex backend → R2 storage → GitHub Actions processing\n\n3. Files and Code Sections:\n   - `/Users/yoav/projects/alignment-hive/docs/memory-system-plan.md`\n     - Main planning document with architecture diagram and session progress\n     - Shows Session 2 open questions about hook behavior\n   \n   - `/Users/yoav/projects/alignment-hive/docs/sessions/session-1-privacy-storage.md`\n     - Previous session decisions: R2 for storage, Stytch for auth, Convex backend\n   \n   - `/Users/yoav/projects/alignment-hive/test-hooks/log-all-events.sh` (CREATED)\n     - Unified hook logging script for testing all hook events\n     ```bash\n     #!/bin/bash\n     # Log ALL hook events to a single file for easy comparison\n\n     LOG_FILE=\"/Users/yoav/projects/alignment-hive/test-hooks/all-events.log\"\n\n     stdin_data=$(cat)\n     timestamp=$(date -u +\"%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%SZ\")\n\n     # Extract hook event name from stdin data\n     event_name=$(echo \"$stdin_data\" | jq -r '.hook_event_name // \"unknown\"')\n\n     # Append to log\n     echo \"[$timestamp] $event_name: $stdin_data\" >> \"$LOG_FILE\"\n     ```\n   \n   - `/Users/yoav/projects/alignment-hive/.claude/settings.local.json` (MODIFIED)\n     - Added hooks for SessionStart, Stop, SessionEnd, and PreCompact\n     ```json\n     {\n       \"permissions\": {\n         \"allow\": [\n           \"mcp__llms-fetch__fetch\",\n           \"WebSearch\"\n         ]\n       },\n       \"hooks\": {\n         \"SessionStart\": [\n           {\n             \"hooks\": [\n               {\n                 \"type\": \"command\",\n                 \"command\": \"/Users/yoav/projects/alignment-hive/test-hooks/log-all-events.sh\"\n               }\n             ]\n           }\n         ],\n         \"Stop\": [\n           {\n             \"hooks\": [\n               {\n                 \"type\": \"command\",\n                 \"command\": \"/Users/yoav/projects/alignment-hive/test-hooks/log-all-events.sh\"\n               }\n             ]\n           }\n         ],\n         \"SessionEnd\": [\n           {\n             \"hooks\": [\n               {\n                 \"type\": \"command\",\n                 \"command\": \"/Users/yoav/projects/alignment-hive/test-hooks/log-all-events.sh\"\n               }\n             ]\n           }\n         ],\n         \"PreCompact\": [\n           {\n             \"hooks\": [\n               {\n                 \"type\": \"command\",\n                 \"command\": \"/Users/yoav/projects/alignment-hive/test-hooks/log-all-events.sh\"\n               }\n             ]\n           }\n         ]\n       }\n     }\n     ```\n\n4. Errors and fixes:\n   - **Hook schema validation error**: Initially tried to configure hooks with direct `type` and `command` at the top level:\n     ```json\n     \"SessionEnd\": [{ \"type\": \"command\", \"command\": \"...\" }]\n     ```\n     Error: `hooks.SessionEnd.0.hooks: Expected array, but received undefined`\n     \n     Fix: Hooks require a nested structure with a `hooks` array:\n     ```json\n     \"SessionEnd\": [{ \"hooks\": [{ \"type\": \"command\", \"command\": \"...\" }] }]\n     ```\n\n5. Problem Solving:\n   - Researched hook documentation to understand SessionEnd reliability\n   - Discovered SessionEnd only fires on clean exit (not crashes/compaction)\n   - Designed test matrix for edge cases (kill signals, compaction, terminal close)\n   - Discussed recovery strategies for lost sessions (3 options: accept loss, heartbeat tracking, periodic checkpoint)\n   - Recommended Option 1 (accept loss) since memory system is opt-in\n\n6. All user messages:\n   - \"Let's keep working on the memory system! I think next is hook behavior user prompting. I want to approach this rigorously and test out everything!\"\n   - \"Ok this is great, let me just note down some thoughts: - Claude code needs to be restarted to load the hooks I'm pretty sure, so the hooks won't run immediately. - I want to test some weird scenarios as well: does the sessionend hook run if I just kill the session instead of doing /exit? Does it run on compaction? Are there other edge cases we should consider? Should we think about state tracking and recovery for lost sessions? - The UI for user approval is its own thing that we need to consider and test carefully and I have a bunch of thoughts on it but we'll get there when we get there\"\n   - \"Before I restart, do we still need the other scripts? Let's keep things clean\"\n\n7. Pending Tasks:\n   - Test SessionEnd on clean exit (/exit, Ctrl+D)\n   - Test SessionEnd on kill signals (kill -9, kill -15)\n   - Test SessionEnd on compaction (/compact)\n   - Test access to session_id and transcript_path in hooks\n   - Design state tracking and recovery for lost sessions (deferred)\n   - UI for user approval (deferred - user said \"we'll get there when we get there\")\n   - Document findings and update memory-system-plan.md\n\n8. Current Work:\n   The test infrastructure for hook behavior testing was just completed. The user cleaned up unused scripts and was about to restart Claude Code to load the hooks and begin testing. The session ended with two `/exit` commands.\n\n   Test matrix to execute:\n   | Scenario | Expected Result | Test Method |\n   |----------|-----------------|-------------|\n   | `/exit` | SessionEnd fires | Normal exit |\n   | `Ctrl+D` | SessionEnd fires | EOF signal |\n   | `kill -15 <pid>` | Maybe fires? | SIGTERM |\n   | `kill -9 <pid>` | Likely no | SIGKILL |\n   | `/compact` | PreCompact fires, NOT SessionEnd | Manual compact |\n\n9. Optional Next Step:\n   After restart, run the hook tests and check `test-hooks/all-events.log` to verify:\n   1. Which hooks fire under which conditions\n   2. What data is in session_id and transcript_path\n   3. Document findings for Session 2\n\n   User's instruction: \"I want to test some weird scenarios as well: does the sessionend hook run if I just kill the session instead of doing /exit? Does it run on compaction?\"\n\n   Command to watch logs: `tail -f test-hooks/all-events.log`."},"isSidechain":false,"isVisibleInTranscriptOnly":true,"isCompactSummary":true}

So we should at least upload session ids, timestamps, and [lack of] decisions, so we can know.\n\nWhich options do you like more or less? Am I forgetting any viable options? Is the a different way of thinking about this? It's really important that the user experience is frictionless, and that we don't needlessly lose transcripts that users would be willing to upload.

I'll blab for a while about my thoughts and then ask you to aggregate at the end. I like a lot of your ideas, but I have slightly different conclusions. Specifically, you should know that users will have the agency to just not use the plugin at all, so if we make it too scary privacy wise or introduce too much burden, we can lose users that way. But I do think that many users will feel fine with default-submit, especially if we let them opt-out of default submit on a per project basis (with a reminder), falling back to per-session opt-in. I'm also realizing something about the session tracking: we need to be able to tell the difference between a session that ended by crashing, and a session that's still running (users might parallelize). To some extent we can get this by adding state tracking via Stop and UserPromptSubmit hooks (toggle between active and inactive). But this won't be perfect—a user can start a session while another session is inactive, and then continue the inactive session. With manual submission this is less of a problem, but with automatic submission we might end up with a lot of duplicates. In fact even SessionEnd doesn't necessarily logically mean that the session ended, the user might continue the conversation. Some users might have long chains that go through many compactions and last many days (if they're lazy about ducomentation and starting new sessions), though that's probably a rare edge case. Ok so basically I think that rather than triggering the processing pipeline right away, we should have a delay that resets after every Stop hook. Does that make sense? This delay can also be used to show the user which sessions they have pending submission and let them opt-out on a session basis as you suggested. I like the notification + user-triggered review pattern as well (whether it's opt-in or opt-out). I think we're going to want a web dashboard very soon, but it's not absolutely necessary right away. Might make it to v1 and might not, let's list it as a NTH. Windows support: if it's easy to make everything cross-platform we should do that, but if it's not we should just defer from v1. Processing pipeline: I really like the idea of letting the agent just completely reject a session based on it containing personal information, or just generally not containing content that's useful for the alignment hive. In that case it shouldn't open a PR, but the processing session should still be sent to be saved in the DB for admin review/debugging. Session chaining schema: feels a bit denormalized to me, I'd like to explore cleaner options.\n\nOk I've blabbed a bunch, I'll let you decide how to proceed from here. Let's make sure we address all open questions and verify our assumptions (if needed)"},"thinkingMetadata":{"level":"high","disabled":false,"triggers":[]},"todos":[],"isSidechain":false}

Let me organize and synthesize:\n\n1. **User agency**: Users can opt-out of the plugin entirely, so we can't be too scary/burdensome\n2. **Default-submit with per-project opt-out**: User likes this, with reminder for opt-out projects\n3. **Session tracking complexity**:\n   - Need to distinguish crashed vs still-running sessions\n   - Users might parallelize sessions\n   - Stop + UserPromptSubmit hooks can toggle active/inactive state\n   - But users can resume \"inactive\" sessions\n   - SessionEnd doesn't mean logical end - user might /resume\n   - Long chains spanning days are possible (rare edge case)\n\n4. **Delay before processing**: Reset delay after every Stop hook. This:\n   - Handles the \"session not really ended\" problem\n   - Gives users time to opt-out\n   - Naturally batches compacted sessions together\n\n5. **Notification + user-triggered review**: User likes this pattern\n\n6. **Web dashboard**: Nice-to-have for v1, not required\n\n7. **Windows support**: Easy = do it, hard = defer\n\n8. **Processing pipeline rejection**: Agent can reject sessions (PII, not useful), still save processing session for admin review\n\n9. **Session chaining schema**: User wants cleaner normalization\n\nLet me think about how to proceed. I should:\n1. Synthesize all the decisions we've made\n2. Address open questions\n3. Propose a cleaner session chaining schema\n4. Create a session 2 notes document\n\nLet me think about the delay mechanism more carefully:\n- After each Stop hook, reset a timer (e.g., 1 hour? 24 hours?)\n- When timer expires, session is considered \"ready for submission\"\n- If session is in default-submit mode, queue it\n- If session is in opt-in mode, notify user\n- If user /resumes before timer expires, timer resets\n\nThis handles:\n\n\n- Parallel sessions (each has its own timer)\n- Long-running sessions (timer keeps resetting)\n- Crashed sessions (timer expires, we know it's not coming back)\n- Compaction chains (timer resets after each compaction's Stop)\n\nI see a clean solution for tracking session timers. The Convex backend can track \"last activity\" per session, which elegantly solves the timer persistence problem. This approach allows hooks to report activity, with Convex managing state and triggering processing when the delay expires.\n\nThe backend tracking method provides flexibility for handling complex session scenarios while maintaining a simple, centralized state management approach. It supports parallel sessions, long-running interactions, and graceful handling of potential session interruptions.\n\nFor session chaining, I'm evaluating three schema design options that address data organization and relationship tracking. Each approach offers unique benefits for managing session continuity and metadata.\n\nOption A uses a parent pointer in the sessions table, allowing chain reconstruction by following parent_id links. This provides a lightweight, direct approach to tracking session relationships.\n\nOption B introduces a separate chains table, creating a more structured way to group sessions. By adding a sequence number, we can precisely order sessions within a chain, offering more explicit relationship management.\n\nOption C takes a minimalist approach, deriving chains through a previous_session_id field. This method keeps the schema simple while still enabling session linkage through a direct reference.\n\nI'm leaning towards Option C as the most straightforward solution. It maintains normalization, avoids additional tables, and captures chain relationships through a clear foreign key mechanism.\n\nNext, I'll focus on key verification points and design decisions, including processing triggers, session schema details, submission defaults, and pipeline rejection behaviors.\n\nMy immediate priority is examining hook payload contents. I'll review the all-events.log file to understand available data, which will help refine our session schema and document critical design choices.\n\nI'll propose a structured approach: first analyze

Stop hook reports activity to backend (resets \"last active\" timestamp)\n2. Backend waits for inactivity delay (e.g., 1 hour? TBD)\n3. When delay expires without activity, session is \"ready\"\n4. If default-submit: queue for processing\n5. If opt-in project: notify user, wait for decision\n\nThis handles:\n- Parallel sessions (each tracked independently)\n- Long-running sessions (timer keeps resetting)\n- Crashed sessions (detected by inactivity timeout)\n- Resumes (same session_id, timer resets)\n\n### Session Schema (Simplified)\n\nNo need for chaining - session_id is stable through compacts:\n\n```\nsessions:\n  id: string (= session_id from hooks)\n  user_id: string\n  project_path: string\n  created_at: timestamp\n  last_activity: timestamp\n  status: \"active\" | \"pending\" | \"submitted\" | \"excluded\"\n  transcript_r2_key: string | null\n  submission_mode: \"default\" | \"opt-in\" (inherited from project setting)\n```\n\n### Processing Pipeline Behavior\n\n- Agent can **reject sessions** (PII detected, not useful content)\n- Rejected sessions: no PR opened, but processing session saved for admin review\n- This allows monitoring rejection rates and patterns\n\n## Open Questions for Future Sessions\n\n### Session 3: Content Format\n- What metadata to extract from transcripts?\n- How to handle the summary entries in processing?\n- Structured output format for extracted knowledge\n\n### Session 5: First-Time Setup\n- User onboarding flow\n- Per-project opt-out configuration\n- Inactivity delay configuration?\n\n### Future: Web Dashboard (Nice-to-Have)\n- View pending/submitted/excluded sessions\n- Batch actions\n- Trust rules (auto-submit certain projects)\n- Submission stats\n\n### Future: Windows Support\n- Only if easy, defer otherwise\n\n## Test Artifacts\n\nTest hooks location: `test-hooks/log-all-events.sh`\nTest log: `test-hooks/all-events.log`\n\nSettings configured in `.claude/settings.local.json`\n"}}],"model":"claude-opus-4-5-20251101","stop_reason":"tool_use","usage":{"input_tokens":8,"cache_creation_input_tokens":484,"cache_read_input_tokens":60600,"cache_creation":{"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":484,"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":0},"output_tokens":1470,"service_tier":"standard"},"type":"message","stop_sequence":null,"context_management":{"applied_edits":[]}},"isSidechain":false,"cwd":"/Users/yoav/projects/alignment-hive","version":"2.0.76","gitBranch":"main"}

Let's iterate a bit, please don't finalize before I confirm.\n- Hooks: I think Stop hook is probably the only one we need. Just queue the session with a 24 hour delay, and update the timestamp at every Stop. Simple and robust (though you should verify that I'm not missing something or leaving value on the table by excluding SessionEnd or other hooks). That said we might want other hooks for UI / user reminders etc\n- Submission decision: we need to flesh out the exact details of the UI a bit more. When is the user prompted to opt-out for the project? Are they reminded of their pending session submissions? What do they do exactly if they want to opt-out/in for a project/session? You mentioned using a custom slash command for this: what does it actually include? Is project opt-out tracked by convex, or locally? How do we track it locally?\n- State tracking: purely convex, or also local? Let's also plan out all of the convex endpoints we need.\n- Unrelated, but I notice that session 3, 4, and 6 are pretty intimately related. Let's merge them into session 6.\n- Re summaries: I'm actually not fully convinced these are generated by compaction, I think they might generate in the background for any session. Could you check the claude code guide for details, or fall back to further experiments? (Though let's not go down this rabbit hole too far, probably more applicable to the processing pipeline session)\n- I'd like to verify one more time that all content from sessions that include compaction makes it into the same file. Consider checking other recent session files for this project\n- I have a general feeling that the main plan file updates are insufficient in terms of the design detail.

Now I have comprehensive information. Let me provide you with a complete answer based on the official documentation and your project findings.\n\n## Summary: Claude Code Transcript Summaries\n\nBased on the Claude Code documentation and your project's Session 2 testing, here are the answers to your questions:\n\n### 1. **When Are Summaries Generated?**\n\n**Summaries are generated ONLY during compaction**, either:\n- **Manual compaction** when you run `/compact`\n- **Auto-compaction** when context window reaches ~95% capacity (triggered automatically)\n\nSummaries are **NOT** generated in the background for regular sessions. They're only created at the explicit compaction moment.\n\n### 2. **Compaction Behavior and Session Tracking**\n\nAccording to your Session 2 testing documentation (https://code.claude.com/docs/en/hooks.md):\n\n- **PreCompact hook** fires before compaction begins\n- **SessionStart hook** fires after compaction completes (with `source: \"compact\"`)\n- The session ID **persists through compaction** — it doesn't change\n- Your project notes state: *\"Compaction adds `summary` entries but does NOT truncate history\"*\n\nThis means the transcript file is **append-only** — summaries are added as new entries, but all previous conversation history is preserved.\n\n### 3. **What Triggers Summary Generation?**\n\nAs documented in the `/costs.md` page:\n- **Manual trigger**: Using `/compact` with custom instructions (e.g., `/compact Focus on code samples and API usage`)\n- **Automatic trigger**: Auto-compact when context reaches 95% capacity\n- **Custom instructions**: You can provide specific summary instructions like:\n  ```\n  /compact Focus on code samples and API usage\n  ```\n  Or configure default instructions in `CLAUDE.md`:\n  ```markdown\n  # Summary instructions\n  When you are using compact, please focus on test output and code changes\n  ```\n\n### 4. **Transcript Entry Structure**\n\nFrom your Session 2 documentation (https://code.claude.com/docs/en/checkpointing.md), the JSONL transcript contains these entry types:\n\n```\nEntry types: `user`, `assistant`, `summary`, `file-history-snapshot`, `system`\nThreading: Each entry has `uuid` and `parentUuid`\n```\n\n**Summary entries specifically**:\n- Are appended to the JSONL file after compaction\n- Contain compressed/summarized conversation history\n- Don't replace or remove previous entries\n- Include thread information (`uuid`, `parentUuid`)\n\n### 5. **Background Token Usage**\n\nInterestingly, the documentation notes that Claude Code does use tokens for background processes:\n\n> \"Conversation summarization: Background jobs that summarize previous conversations for the `claude --resume` feature\"\n\nThis suggests that summaries may also be generated **behind the scenes** for the resume feature (`claude --resume`), separate from compaction-triggered summaries.

I'm still unconvinced about the summaries, but tbh I think we need a dedicated session just to fully reverse-engineer the jsonl format. Can you add it before the processing pipeline session? We're going to want a deep and accurate understanding of the file format in order to fully utilize it. Stop + SessionStart sounds good. I'm also realizing that we're not actually going to be able to autonomously submit the file after exactly 24 hours, I think we should submit qualified files via the SessionStart hook. We could even add an additional ~5 minute delay (via an actual background script) during which the user has a final chance to opt-out. Project opt-out tracking: I don't like this design, let's talk about it some more. In terms of UX, I want the user to simply be reminded that they can opt out for the project (via SessionStart hook) until the first session for the project has been submitted. I don't think /memory is a good UI for opting out (there's already a native /memory command that means something else), ideally it should be a command that the plugin provides with a descriptive name for what it does, and it should execute programatically (not by prompting the model). Or I guess I'm not sure slash commands support argument syntax that can then be used in a programatic call. It'd be really nice if the commands didn't prompt the model at all, I don't know if this is possible. Possibly slash commands are the wrong abstraction and we should just have the user run a script (they can do this from within claude code by typing ! first). But let's verify this fact about slash commands. Another UI thing: when working in a project where the user has opted-out, they should be reminded of this status and the SessionStart hook should just remind them of this status and tell them the command for opting back in. I realize that I have an open question for how hooks show information to the user: can information make it to the user but not Claude? (it's irrelevant and possibly distracting for the model). Re the breakdown to status/config/exclude/submit: not sure I like this. I want a user flow that is more optimized for the exact actions users are going to want to take. So rather than a general \"config\" I want a more concrete command for opting out for the current project (not sure what to call it), and for opting back in. Rather than a generic \"status\", I want to optimize more directly for per-session opt out. And I want the user to never have to type out a session id. If they have to copy paste maybe that's good enough, but even better is if a short session description is displayed to them and them can either say in natural language that they want to opt out for it, or respond to a question via the ask question tool, or maybe even selecting interactively via cli. Let's explore each of these options, not sure what I think is best. I don't think we need a force submit command. Pending session reminders: I'd like to display a short session description for each of the pending sessions, along with the time remaining to opt-out. Claude code somehow stores these descriptions (maybe these are what the summaries are for?), so we should be able to extract them. And if we end up going with copy-pasting the id as the opt-out UI, we'll also want to display the id (or a short prefix). Flow: I think actually convex shouldn't control the submission timing, just keep track of the existance of the session and the timestamp of its last stop hook. The client can simply go off of last modified time for the session file. Explicit session submit for opt-in projects is interesting, but it's unclear to me what prompts the user to submit a session or where do they get the id from in the case of id-based submit. Let's defer for now, I expect users to mostly opt-out for a project if it's a personal project and I'm ok losing all of those sessions for now. Local state: good I think. Convex state: let's also add in the number of messages (lines) in the session. Maintains privacy, but lets us discard tiny sessions when tracking usage and submission stats. When documenting let's also make it clear that the fine details of the schema are subject to change if during implementation we find out we've forgotten something. Proposed endpoints: I like heartbeat, register, upload, exclude. I don't like that we have different url prefixes: \"transcript\" and \"session\" are very similar. And I don't understand the difference between /upload and /submit. Pending: this should be computed locally imo (if we want to display it in a web app later it should be a convex query, not an http endpoint). And I'm not realizing we also need to locally keep track of session-level exclude decisions (convex tracking only for stats/debugging). So basically the source of truth for status is local and replicated to convex for tracking purposes. Internal mutations: let's defer the processing related stuff to the processing pipeline session, just note that the file upload should trigger the processing pipeline. No need for the cronjob, client decides when the session is ready.\n\nOk that was a lot.

I now have comprehensive documentation to answer all three questions. Let me provide you with detailed answers based on the official Claude Code documentation.\n\n## 1. Slash Commands: Programmatic Execution Without Model Involvement\n\n**Yes, but with important caveats:**\n\nSlash commands can execute in two ways:\n\n**A) Direct User Invocation (No Claude Involved)**\nWhen you run `/my-command arg1`, the command executes immediately through bash command execution defined in the command's frontmatter. The output is shown to you directly without Claude being involved at all. This is the simplest form.\n\n**B) Claude Programmatic Invocation (Model-Mediated)**\nThere's a separate mechanism called the `SlashCommand` tool that allows Claude to execute custom slash commands during a conversation. From the documentation:\n\n> The `SlashCommand` tool allows Claude to execute [custom slash commands](/en/slash-commands#custom-slash-commands) programmatically during a conversation.\n\nTo prevent a specific command from being available to Claude's `SlashCommand` tool, use:\n\n```markdown\n---\ndisable-model-invocation: true\n---\n```\n\nThis prevents Claude from executing it but allows direct user invocation. From the docs:\n\n> To prevent a specific slash command from becoming available, add `disable-model-invocation: true` to the slash command's frontmatter. This also removes the command's metadata from context.\n\nSo if you want a command that runs purely as a script without Claude involvement, direct user invocation is your answer.\n\n## 2. Hook Output to User Without Claude Seeing It\n\n**Yes, but it depends on the hook type and output method:**\n\nFrom the documentation, there's a critical distinction:\n\n> Claude Code does not see stdout if the exit code is 0, except for the `UserPromptSubmit` hook where stdout is injected as context.\n\nHere's the breakdown by hook type:\n\n| Hook Type | Behavior |\n|-----------|----------|\n| **PreToolUse, PostToolUse, PreCompact, SessionEnd** | `stdout` shown to user in verbose mode (Ctrl+O), **NOT added to Claude's context** |\n| **UserPromptSubmit, SessionStart** | `stdout` IS added to Claude's context |\n| **Notification** | Only shown to user, Claude doesn't see it |\n| **Stop, SubagentStop** | Output shown to Claude |\n\n**Best approach for user-only output:** Use hooks like `PreToolUse`, `PostToolUse`, or `SessionStart` with exit code 0. The output displays in verbose mode but is not added to Claude's context (except for UserPromptSubmit/SessionStart where you can use the `additionalContext` field in JSON output if you want structured context).\n\nFor example, a SessionStart hook showing \"3 pending sessions\" with this bash script:\n\n```bash\n#!/bin/bash\necho \"3 pending sessions waiting for review\"\nexit 0  # Exit code 0 means success, won't show to Claude (except SessionStart adds it)\n```\n\nFor SessionStart specifically, if you want to show output without adding context, this is complex—the documentation notes that context is added. Use JSON output format instead:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"hookSpecificOutput\": {\n    \"hookEventName\": \"SessionStart\",\n    \"additionalContext\": \"optional context\"\n  }\n}\n```\n\n## 3. Interactive CLI from Hooks\n\n**Limited support, not recommended:**\n\nThe documentation doesn't explicitly cover interactive CLI tools like `fzf` or arrow-key selection in hooks. However, from the reference docs:\n\n> Hooks are shell commands that execute at various points in Claude Code's lifecycle.\n\nHooks execute in the background during the agent loop with constraints:\n\n- **Timeout**: 60-second execution limit by default\n- **Parallelization**: All matching hooks run in parallel\n- **Input**: JSON via stdin\n- **Environment**: No guaranteed terminal interactivity\n\nThe critical issue is that hooks don't have guaranteed access to an interactive terminal. From the hooks guide:\n\n> Claude Code hooks are user-defined shell commands that execute at various points in Claude Code's lifecycle... ensure certain actions always happen rather than relying on the LLM to choose to run them.\n\nSince hooks are designed for deterministic, automated execution in the background, interactive CLI tools like `fzf` that require terminal input would not work reliably. The hook would timeout waiting for user input (60 seconds max), and there's no guarantee the terminal is available.\n\n**Better alternatives:**\n- Use slash commands for interactive workflows (users explicitly invoke them)\n- Use `Notification` hooks to display information and ask users to run a slash command\n- Design hooks to be fully automated without user interaction\n\n---\n\nSources:\n- [Slash commands - Claude Code Docs](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/slash-commands.md)\n- [Hooks reference - Claude Code Docs](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/hooks.md)\n- [Get started with Claude Code hooks - Claude Code Docs](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/hooks-guide.md)"},{"type":"text","text":"agentId: aa86a34 (for resuming to continue this agent's work if needed)"}]}]},"isSidechain":false}

Otherwise, it displays the initial prompt from the session\n- **Time elapsed since last activity**\n- **Message count**\n- **Git branch** (if applicable)\n\nSo the \"description\" shown in the picker is either:\n- A user-provided **session name** (set via `/rename` command)\n- Or the **first user prompt** from the session (if not renamed)\n\n### 2. **Session Storage and JSONL Format**\n\nThe documentation doesn't explicitly detail the JSONL transcript format or whether there's a separate \"summary\" field in the stored data. However, based on the [common-workflows resume section](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/common-workflows.md#how-it-works), when resuming:\n\n1. **Conversation Storage**: All conversations are automatically saved locally with their full message history\n2. **Message Deserialization**: When resuming, the entire message history is restored\n3. **Tool State**: Tool usage and results from the previous conversation are preserved\n4. **Context Restoration**: The conversation resumes with all previous context intact\n\nThe picker metadata (name, message count, timestamp, branch) appears to be stored separately from the message content itself, likely as session metadata alongside the JSONL transcript file.\n\n### 3. **Programmatic Access to Session Descriptions**\n\nThe documentation doesn't explicitly detail a public API for programmatically accessing session descriptions. However, based on available commands:\n\n- **`/resume` command** - Opens an interactive picker showing all sessions with metadata\n- **`claude --resume session-name`** - Resume by name directly\n- **`claude --continue`** - Resume the most recent session\n\nThe CLI reference and common-workflows documentation don't mention programmatic APIs for reading session metadata directly. For programmatic access, you would likely need to:\n- Access the session files directly from the storage location (typically `.claude/sessions/` in your project directory, though this isn't documented)\n- Parse the session metadata files that accompany the JSONL transcripts\n\n**Recommendation**: Since this isn't documented in the official Claude Code documentation, I'd suggest:\n1.

How does this work? (I know that usually it does prompt the model)\n- I guess we can live with some added noise in the context as long as it's short\n- Interactive CLI in hooks: that's not what I meant. If we want we can just launch a background process from a hook (for delayed submission), and for interactivity the user would be running the CLI from a separate terminal window\n- Session descriptions source: I'm pretty sure this is wrong. I think haiku generates one, and I think it's probably somewhere in the jsonl file. But no need to verify right now\n\nRevised design:\n\n- Hooks good\n- Claude context: what do you mean by \"additionalContext\" and JSON output? Would this be displayed to the user and not claude? Though probably I'd prefer a textual format even if that means adding some noise to claude's context. Doing work silently is not what we want I think\n- Submission flow: good. I'd just add that the startsession hook also checks for sessions with last modified < 24h ago, to display to the user for exclusion. I think I like the background script delay for final opt-out, and let's actually make it 10 minutes (when the script wakes up it checks for exclusion)\n- Local state: if this is the recommended pattern that's fine, I'd just like to point out that there's a folder for each plugin (i.e. ~/.claude/plugins/marketplaces/alignment-hive/plugins/project-setup). Not sure if this is supposed to be writeable though. But I'd do another check in the docs and online for whether there's an official pattern for this\n- Convex state: status can also be pending. Instead of `project_path_hash`, let's just have `project: string | undefined` and only populate it on submit.\n- Convex endpoints: I like the simplifications! So \"heartbeat\" would create the session if it doesn't exist right? Let's lose the \"/api\", just \"session/*\"\n- Notification hook seems incorrect for our use case. But let's explore the JSON output option a bit. I'm seeing there's a systemMessage? Maybe that's helpful? I want to list out the options and then we can test them out (possibly in a separate sub-session)\n- Yeah I'm pretty sure custom slash commands always prompt the model (I just checked the docs). I think if we end up distributing a cli tool then that would be the best way of doing it, and otherwise we can fall back to slash commands (even though it isn't a perfect abstraction). We're going to decide whether to distribute a cli tool during the initial-setup session, so let's defer to then. Script would have interactive selection rather than numbering.\n- Opt out timing: the user can opt-out at any time before the session is submitted (and is reminded of that option starting right when they start their next session). After submit the processing starts right away, but the user can \"yank\". We're not going to implement yanking in v1 though, I'm fine with implementing it just in time when a user requests it for the first time.\n- Project opt-out reminder UX: correct\n- Session description: we should figure out how cluade code implements it (again, I suspect there's a summary message in the transcript). Can be defered until after reverse engineering session. We can defer whether to include a session id prefix until implementation"},"thinkingMetadata":{"level":"high","disabled":false,"triggers":[]},"todos":[],"isSidechain":false}

I have found the official documentation for all three of your questions. Let me provide comprehensive answers:\n\n## 1. Slash Commands: Model Invocation vs Direct Execution\n\nFrom the official documentation, here's the key distinction:\n\n**When a USER runs a custom slash command, it ALWAYS goes through the model** - unless you explicitly prevent it with `disable-model-invocation: true`.\n\nThe relevant mechanism is the **SlashCommand tool**:\n\n- Claude Code includes all custom slash commands in context via the `SlashCommand` tool\n- When you run `/my-command`, Claude receives the command and processes it as context\n- The command content is then executed with Claude's involvement\n\n**To prevent model invocation**, add this to your command's frontmatter:\n\n```markdown\n---\ndisable-model-invocation: true\ndescription: Your command description\n---\n\nYour command content here\n```\n\nFrom the documentation:\n\n> \"To prevent a specific slash command from becoming available, add `disable-model-invocation: true` to the slash command's frontmatter. This also removes the command's metadata from context.\"\n\nThis means:\n- With `disable-model-invocation: false` (default): Claude sees the command, can invoke it, processes it\n- With `disable-model-invocation: true`: The command is hidden from Claude and the SlashCommand tool cannot invoke it, but YOU can still run it manually from the command line\n\n---\n\n## 2. Plugin Local State Storage Pattern\n\nThe official pattern for plugin local state is **`.local.md` files** with YAML frontmatter:\n\n**Pattern**: `.claude/plugin-name.local.md`\n\nFrom the plugin settings documentation:\n> \"Documents the `.claude/plugin-name.local.md` pattern for storing plugin-specific configuration with YAML frontmatter and markdown content.\"\n\n**Example structure**:\n\n```markdown\n---\nsetting1: value1\nsetting2: value2\napi_key: secret_value\n---\n\n# Plugin Configuration\n\nAny markdown content describing the state or configuration.\n```\n\n**Key characteristics**:\n- File lives in `.claude/` directory (at project root)\n- Named as `plugin-name.local.md` \n- Uses YAML frontmatter for structured data\n- Per-project basis (stored locally, not committed)\n- Plugins can read/write this file to persist state between sessions\n\nThis is the officially recommended pattern mentioned in your available skills: `/plugin-dev:plugin-settings` which explicitly documents this pattern.\n\n---\n\n## 3. Hook JSON Output Fields (Complete Reference)\n\nHere are ALL available hook JSON output fields, organized by hook type:\n\n### Common Fields (All Hook Types)\n\n```json\n{\n  \"continue\": true/false,           // Whether Claude continues (default: true)\n  \"stopReason\": \"string\",           // Message shown when continue is false\n  \"suppressOutput\": true/false,     // Hide stdout from transcript (default: false)\n  \"systemMessage\": \"string\"         // Optional warning shown to user\n}\n```\n\n### SessionStart Hook JSON Output\n\n```json\n{\n  \"hookSpecificOutput\": {\n    \"hookEventName\": \"SessionStart\",\n    \"additionalContext\": \"string\"   // Context added at session start\n  }\n}\n```\n\n### PreToolUse Hook JSON Output\n\n```json\n{\n  \"hookSpecificOutput\": {\n    \"hookEventName\": \"PreToolUse\",\n    \"permissionDecision\": \"allow\" | \"deny\" | \"ask\",\n    \"permissionDecisionReason\": \"string\",\n    \"updatedInput\": {               // Modify tool inputs before execution\n      \"field_to_modify\": \"new value\"\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\n### PostToolUse Hook JSON Output\n\n```json\n{\n  \"decision\": \"block\" | undefined,\n  \"reason\": \"string\",\n  \"hookSpecificOutput\": {\n    \"hookEventName\": \"PostToolUse\",\n    \"additionalContext\": \"string\"   // Context for Claude after tool execution\n  }\n}\n```\n\n### UserPromptSubmit Hook JSON Output\n\n```json\n{\n  \"decision\": \"block\" | undefined,\n  \"reason\": \"string\",\n  \"hookSpecificOutput\": {\n    \"hookEventName\": \"UserPromptSubmit\",\n    \"additionalContext\": \"string\"   // Context added to conversation\n  }\n}\n```\n\n### Stop/SubagentStop Hook JSON Output\n\n```json\n{\n  \"decision\": \"block\" | undefined,\n  \"reason\": \"string (required if decision is 'block')\"\n}\n```\n\n### PermissionRequest Hook JSON Output\n\n```json\n{\n  \"hookSpecificOutput\": {\n    \"hookEventName\": \"PermissionRequest\",\n    \"decision\": {\n      \"behavior\": \"allow\" | \"deny\",\n      \"updatedInput\": {             // Only for allow\n        \"field_to_modify\": \"new value\"\n      },\n      \"message\": \"string\",          // Only for deny\n      \"interrupt\": true/false       // Only for deny - stops Claude\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\n### Key Points About Hook Output\n\n1. **Exit code 0** with JSON in stdout = structured control\n2. **Exit code 2** = blocking error (stderr shown, JSON ignored)\n3. **Other exit codes** = non-blocking error\n4. `additionalContext` is the main field for injecting information into Claude's context for SessionStart, PostToolUse, and UserPromptSubmit hooks\n5. `permissionDecision` (PreToolUse) and `behavior` (PermissionRequest) control whether tools execute\n6. `updatedInput` allows modification of tool parameters before execution\n7. `continue: false` takes precedence over any other decision field\n\n---\n\n## Summary\n\nYour three questions about Claude Code now have definitive answers from official documentation:\n\n1. **Slash commands always go through the model** unless you add `disable-model-invocation: true` to block them\n2. **Plugin state pattern is `.claude/plugin-name.local.md`** with YAML frontmatter for structured data\n3. **Hook JSON fields** vary by hook type, with `additionalContext` for SessionStart/PostToolUse/UserPromptSubmit, and hook-specific decision fields for permission/blocking control\n\nAll of this is documented at https://code.claude.com/docs/en/ in the slash-commands, plugins-reference, and hooks reference pages."},{"type":"text","text":"agentId: a8b829f (for resuming to continue this agent's work if needed)"}]}]},"isSidechain":false}

I don't want to overload this session, so please add a session right after this for discussing them. That said there's one idea that's particularly relevant: I think that it would be best if the plugin was installed at the project scope, rather than user scope. When setting up a new project, users will have to set up the plugin in order to benefit from retrieval. But then collaborators would automatically have access. State tracking and auth credentials should probably be in the same place in the ~/.claude folder, but we no longer need to track project opt-out. We just need to decide re .local.md, and then verify we haven't forgotten anything!"},"thinkingMetadata":{"level":"high","disabled":false,"triggers":[]},"todos":[],"isSidechain":false}

Store plugin-specific configuration in `.claude/settings.local.json` (for settings)\n2. Or store plugin instructions/state in `.claude/CLAUDE.local.md` with YAML frontmatter\n\nYour custom skill description mentions: \"Documents the .claude/plugin-name.local.md pattern for storing plugin-specific configuration with YAML frontmatter and markdown content\" — but this doesn't appear in official Claude Code documentation as a standard pattern.\n\n---\n\n**Recommendation**: Verify with `/feedback` whether the `.claude/plugin-name.local.md` pattern for plugin state is:\n- An undocumented but supported convention\n- A custom pattern your team should document in your CLAUDE.md\n- A feature request that should be formally documented\n\nSources:\n- [Claude Code Settings Documentation](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/settings.md)\n- [Claude Code Plugins Reference](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/plugins-reference.md)"},{"type":"text","text":"agentId: adc4377 (for resuming to continue this agent's work if needed)"}]}]},"isSidechain":false}
