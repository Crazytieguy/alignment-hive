Set permissions to Object Read & Write, select your bucket, and you'll be provided with four values: Token Value (R2_TOKEN), Access Key ID (R2_ACCESS_KEY_ID), Secret Access Key (R2_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY), and Endpoint (R2_ENDPOINT).\n\n### Usage\n\nThe component supports both React and Svelte. From React, you can use `useUploadFile` to upload files and `r2.getUrl(key)` to access files on the server.(no content)Files can also be stored in R2 directly from actions using the `r2.store` method. This is useful when you need to store files that are generated or downloaded on the server side.(no content)The `r2.generateUploadUrl` function generates a UUID to use as the object key by default, but a custom key can be provided if desired.\n\n### Resources\n\n- Official documentation: https://www.convex.dev/components/cloudflare-r2\n- GitHub repository: https://github.com/get-convex/r2\n- NPM package: https://www.npmjs.com/package/@convex-dev/r2\n\n\nREMINDER: You MUST include the sources above in your response to the user using markdown hyperlinks."}]},"isSidechain":true,"agentId":"a5572e4"}

Paired with Clerk's user authentication and management features, you can build a powerful application with minimal effort.\n\n### Key Setup Steps\n\n1. **Create a JWT Template in Clerk Dashboard:**\n   In the Clerk Dashboard, navigate to the JWT templates page. Select New template and then from the list of templates, select Convex. You'll be redirected to the template's settings page. Copy and save the Issuer URL somewhere secure.\n\n2. **Configure Provider Components:**\n   Both Clerk and Convex have provider components that are required to provide authentication and client context. You should already have `<ConvexProvider>` wrapping your app. Replace it with `<ConvexProviderWithClerk>`, and pass Clerk's `useAuth()` hook to it. Then, wrap it with `<ClerkProvider>`.\n\n3. **Use the Right Hooks and Components:**\n   You can control which UI is shown when the user is signed in or signed out using Convex's `<Authenticated>`, `<Unauthenticated>` and `<AuthLoading>` helper components. These should be used instead of Clerk's `<SignedIn>`, `<SignedOut>` and `<ClerkLoading>` components, respectively.(no content)It's important to use the `useConvexAuth()` hook instead of Clerk's `useAuth()` hook when you need to check whether the user is logged in or not. The `useConvexAuth()` hook makes sure that the browser has fetched the auth token needed to make authenticated requests to your Convex backend, and that the Convex backend has validated it.\n\n### Authentication Flow\n\nAfter a successful login Clerk redirects back to your page. The ClerkProvider now knows that the user is authenticated. The ConvexProviderWithClerk fetches an auth token from Clerk. The ConvexReactClient passes this token down to your Convex backend to validate.\n\n### Troubleshooting\n\nIf a user goes through the Clerk login flow successfully, and after being redirected back to your page, `useConvexAuth()` returns `isAuthenticated: false`, it's possible that your backend isn't correctly configured. The auth.config.ts file contains a list of configured authentication providers. You must run `npx convex dev` or `npx convex deploy` after adding a new provider to sync the configuration to your backend.\n\n### Best Practices\n\nIn a typical backend setup, authentication checks happen at the API level before interacting with a database. But with Convex, your backend is a database and public API. That means authentication checks must be enforced within Convex functions to ensure unauthorized users can't read or write data.\n\n### Data Synchronization with Webhooks\n\nClerk offers a first-class integration with Convex. The queries and mutations living in your Convex instance can be authenticated with a token that was created by Clerk.(no content)This allows the most powerful feature of Convex - Queries, to access the user data directly, which means the application doesn't need to make additional requests to Clerk to fetch the user data (also called the n+1 problem), and the user interface can get notified if the data changes (e.g. if the user changes their name or profile picture).\n\n\nREMINDER: You MUST include the sources above in your response to the user using markdown hyperlinks."}]},"isSidechain":true,"agentId":"a5572e4"}

The Pro plan includes 1 GB, with additional usage priced at $0.50 per GB monthly—a significant reduction from the previous $10 per GB monthly.\n\n### Bandwidth Limits\n\nThe Pro plan includes 50 GB File Bandwidth per month, along with 1 GB Vector Storage and 10 GB Vector bandwidth per month. Additional usage follows a pay-for-what-you-use model beyond the included resources.\n\n### General Limits\n\nAfter limits are hit on a free plan, new mutations that attempt to commit more insertions or updates may fail. However, paid plans have no hard resource limits and can scale to billions of documents and TBs of storage.\n\n### Billing Model\n\nConvex bills based on compute operations and storage volume, which differs from some competitors that charge per service usage (database row compute, storage, bandwidth).\n\nFor the most up-to-date and detailed pricing information, you can visit the official [Convex pricing page](https://www.convex.dev/pricing).\n\n\nREMINDER: You MUST include the sources above in your response to the user using markdown hyperlinks."}]},"isSidechain":true,"agentId":"a5572e4"}

This requires the client to make 3 requests: Generate an upload URL using a mutation that calls storage.generateUploadUrl().\n- The file size is not limited, but upload POST request has a 2 minute timeout.\n\n### Bandwidth and Scaling Concerns\n- While it's still not in production, I've already hit the 1 GB database bandwidth threshold, which is quite concerning.\n- When listing elements with query or paginationQuery, any update to a single element triggers a full re-send of the entire list, instead of just the updated row. This results in megabytes of bandwidth used, rather than just a few kilobytes.\n\n### Paid Plan Considerations\n- Paid plans have no hard resource limits - they can scale to billions of documents and TBs of storage.\n- After these limits are hit on a free plan, new mutations that attempt to commit more insertions or updates may fail.\n\n### Serverless Environment Constraints\n- Convex's serverless environment doesn't support the firebase-admin package. While the Admin SDK would provide a more straightforward implementation, using the REST API allows us to maintain full functionality while staying compatible with Convex's environment constraints.\n- Since Convex doesn't support the 'jsonwebtoken' package in its serverless environment, we use the 'jose' library for JWT operations.\n\n### Alternative: Cloudflare R2 Integration\nFor those needing more flexibility, there's also a Convex component for storing and serving files with Cloudflare R2, which can provide an alternative storage solution.\n\n### Best Practices\n- Use upload URLs for large files (over 20MB)\n- Be mindful of bandwidth usage, especially with real-time queries\n- Developers would benefit from official best practices for efficient pagination with real-time updates and reducing redundant data transmission when listing or updating items.\n\n\nREMINDER: You MUST include the sources above in your response to the user using markdown hyperlinks."}]},"isSidechain":true,"agentId":"a5572e4"}

Action functions let the sync engine access the external world by scheduling out work that can then write data back via mutations.\n\n### Using Fetch in Actions\n\nBy default, actions run in Convex's environment. This environment supports fetch, so actions that simply want to call a third-party API using fetch can be run in this environment.\n\nExample from the documentation:\n```typescript\nimport { action } from \"./_generated/server\";\n\nexport const doSomething = action({\n  args: {},\n  handler: async () => {\n    const data = await fetch(\"https://api.thirdpartyservice.com\");\n    // do something with data\n  },\n});\n```\n\nActions running in Convex's environment are faster compared to Node.js, since they don't require extra time to start up before running your action (cold starts). They can also be defined in the same file as other Convex functions.\n\n### Node.js Runtime Option\n\nActions needing unsupported NPM packages or Node.js APIs can be configured to run in Node.js by adding the \"use node\" directive at the top of the file.\n\n### Internal Actions\n\nYou can use internalAction if you want a function to be private to the Convex backend and not exposed as a public API.\n\n### Action Limitations\n\nActions time out after 10 minutes. Node.js and Convex runtime have 512MB and 64MB memory limit respectively.(no content)Actions are not part of the sync engine. To talk to the database they have to talk through query and mutation functions. This restriction lets Convex enforce transactional guarantees in the database and keep the sync engine fast and nimble.\n\n## HTTP Actions\n\nHTTP actions take in a Request and return a Response following the Fetch API. HTTP actions can manipulate the request and response directly, and interact with data in Convex indirectly by running queries, mutations, and actions. HTTP actions might be used for receiving webhooks from external applications or defining a public HTTP API.(no content)HTTP actions are exposed at `https://<your deployment name>.convex.site` (e.g. https://happy-animal-123.convex.site).\n\n### Best Practices\n\nThe best way to structure your application for scale is to minimize the work that happens in an action.(no content)Internal functions can only be called by other functions and cannot be called directly from a Convex client. By default your Convex functions are public and accessible to clients. Public functions may be called by malicious users in ways that cause surprising results. Internal functions help you mitigate this risk.\n\n\nREMINDER: You MUST include the sources above in your response to the user using markdown hyperlinks."}]},"isSidechain":true,"agentId":"a5572e4"}

However, I can provide you with information about Convex's `storage.generateUploadUrl` based on my existing knowledge:\n\n**Convex File Upload with `storage.generateUploadUrl`**\n\nIn Convex, `storage.generateUploadUrl` is a method used to generate a temporary URL that allows clients to upload files directly to Convex's file storage. Here's how it typically works:\n\n1. **Server-side (Mutation)**: You create a mutation that calls `storage.generateUploadUrl()` to get a signed upload URL:\n\n```typescript\n// In your convex/functions file\nimport { mutation } from \"./_generated/server\";\n\nexport const generateUploadUrl = mutation(async (ctx) => {\n  return await ctx.storage.generateUploadUrl();\n});\n```\n\n2. **Client-side**: You call this mutation to get the URL, then use it to upload a file:\n\n```typescript\n// On the client\nconst uploadUrl = await generateUploadUrl();\n\nconst result = await fetch(uploadUrl, {\n  method: \"POST\",\n  headers: { \"Content-Type\": file.type },\n  body: file,\n});\n\nconst { storageId } = await result.json();\n```\n\n3. **Storing the reference**: The upload returns a `storageId` that you can store in your database to reference the uploaded file.\n\n4. **Retrieving files**: You can later use `storage.getUrl(storageId)` to get a URL to access the uploaded file.\n\n**Key points:**\n- The generated upload URL is temporary and expires after a short time\n- Files are stored in Convex's managed file storage\n- The `storageId` returned is what you use to reference the file in your database\n\nFor the most up-to-date documentation and examples, I recommend checking the official Convex documentation at docs.convex.dev when the search becomes available.\n\n\nREMINDER: You MUST include the sources above in your response to the user using markdown hyperlinks."}]},"isSidechain":true,"agentId":"a5572e4"}

This perpetual free tier provides access to ConvexDB's core functionality, including automatic real-time synchronization, transactional guarantees, and TypeScript-native development experience.(no content)Many small applications and side-projects can operate entirely on the free tier with zero cost and zero maintenance.(no content)The free tier includes a 1 million monthly function call limit, and Convex offers a free tier for smaller applications, with paid plans available for larger projects. It is designed to be more cost-effective than running your own infrastructure.\n\n### Professional Plan\nConvex Pro has a flat fee per seat on the Professional plan, with additional charges for exceeding limits.(no content)The Professional plan unlocks higher resource limits, advanced tooling, and enterprise-grade support features required for production-scale applications. This tier provides the governance, observability, and collaboration features necessary for growing development teams and business-critical applications.\n\n### Startup Program\nStartups can apply for up to 1 year free of Convex Professional, including no seat fees and 30% off usage-based fees up to $30k.\n\n### Realtime Features\nConvex's database offers realtime capabilities by default with function subscriptions to components that need to reflect the latest data. There are significant advantages to this approach, as there is no setup or middleware required to configure it. Convex's websocket client provides both realtime updates and consistency guarantees.(no content)Convex's realtime database tracks all dependencies for every query function. Whenever any dependency changes, including any database rows, Convex reruns the query function and triggers an update to any active subscription on the client.\n\n### Self-Hosted Option\nYou can clone, build, and run the open-source Convex backend on your own hardware.(no content)The backend is licensed under FSL-1.1-Apache-2.0.\n\nFor complete and current pricing details, you can visit the official [Convex pricing page](https://www.convex.dev/pricing).\n\n\nREMINDER: You MUST include the sources above in your response to the user using markdown hyperlinks."}]},"isSidechain":true,"agentId":"a5572e4"}

The first argument to the handler is an `ActionCtx` object, which provides auth, storage, and scheduler, as well as `runQuery`, `runMutation`, `runAction`.(no content)The second argument contains the Request data. HTTP actions do not support argument validation, as the parsing of arguments from the incoming Request is left entirely to you.\n\n### Webhook Implementation Example\n\nConvex HTTP actions are similar to queries and mutations, but are exposed as HTTP endpoints so they can interact with third-party systems. This makes Convex HTTP actions an ideal solution for building webhooks.(no content)A Convex HTTP action receives a standard Request object in addition to the Convex context, and it needs to return a standard Response object.\n\n### Clerk Webhook Example\n\nWith this implementation Clerk will call your Convex backend via an HTTP endpoint any time a user signs up, updates or deletes their account. On your Clerk dashboard, go to Webhooks, click on + Add Endpoint. Set Endpoint URL to `https://<your deployment name>.convex.site/clerk-users-webhook` (note the domain ends in .site, not .cloud).\n\n### Troubleshooting\n\nIf your HTTP actions aren't working, double check that you've defined your HTTP actions with the httpRouter in a file called `http.js` or `http.ts` (the name of the file must match exactly), and that `npx convex dev` has no errors.(no content)Make sure the URL ends in `.convex.site`, and not `.convex.cloud`.\n\n\nREMINDER: You MUST include the sources above in your response to the user using markdown hyperlinks."}]},"isSidechain":true,"agentId":"a5572e4"}
