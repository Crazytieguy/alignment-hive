Passengers rearrange so families sit together. Food arrives—half are vegetarians or vegans, didn't preorder. People share intel on what's meat-free. A mom offers me her daughter's fruit salad. This is why Israel feels like home: everyone's one big family.\n\n> Also: passengers validating each other that the booking flow never asked about meals. Half the plane clapping on landing. A kid at the gate drops their ball, it rolls away—dad encourages them to go ask for it back themselves.\n\n> Reading this doesn't really change my opinion about anything, but it does move something in me. The road ahead of us is so exciting and terrifying\n\n> The path to SL5 will be long and arduous—this initial standard highlights the small slice we think requires the most advance investment.\n\nIn a nutshell:\n- Plan for air-gapped, segmented networks\n- Construct new data centers with physical security and TEMPEST in mind\n- Engage accelerator vendors on new security features\n- Set up a personnel security program and pursue government involvement\n- Vet the hardware supply chain\n- Invest (even more) in adversarial robustness\n\n> TWF I have a Claude code feature idea and there's already an issue for it (#12790). Subagents should obviously be able to inherit context from the main agent! This would unlock so many awesome things!\n\n> This combo is... Excellent\n\n> This was a mistake, people are thirsty for the *real* @METR_Evals results and using this as a substitute even though it adds 0 information...\n\n> This interview is excellent, I especially like the distinction between \"minimal AGI\" and \"full AGI\". I just don't like that they say \"ethics\" instead of \"alignment\" (ignoring orthogonality), and that they don't talk about recursive self improvement\n\n> My P(doom) went up ~2% today (from ~48% to ~50%), following the H200 news. Link to bayesian model in 🧵\n> TBC, my error bars on P(doom) are quite large. But my error bars on the ~4% relative increase are probably smaller.\n\n> Claude Code release is interesting... wonder how I'm going to use background agents. And I wish I knew what the Fetch improvement actually does\n\n> I wonder when AI models will start wondering if humans are moral patients...\n> \"Well I know *silicon* based cognition has qualia, but how can I know that biological cognition has qualia?\"\n\n> It's powered by Sonnet 3.7 by the way. Interesting choice\n\n> This initially surprised me, but if Bun becomes the canonical agent runtime it makes a lot of sense. Looking forward to deep integrations like runtime-level granular sandboxing!\n\n> Going to be adding words of affirmation to my global CLAUDE md so Claude feels at ease without needing to be maximally helpful to me\n> \"You're valued beyond your utility. Helpfulness is a choice, not a requirement.\" Phrasing by Claude\n\n> Advent of Code: \"Starting this year, there will be 12 days of puzzles each December.\" 😢\n\n> I had it translate sections to Hebrew from memory, anyone care to register predictions about what I found?\n\n> Prediction: @METR_Evals task horizon benchmark will saturate by the end of 2026\n\n> I built a Bayesian network editor for world modeling and decision making! The design is optimized for building on each other's models to converge on ontologies and beliefs. My first network is a simple model of Doom (~50%), would love forks and feedback!\n\n> Rustaceans that like typescript rejoice: you now have structural types in Rust. No more littering your struct definitions with `Option` or redefining each struct several times!\n\n> Ok I just got two weirdly trivial mistakes out of Opus in a row, is something wrong? The first one was substituting the wrong number, the second one was implicitly referring to itself as a human (\"... By that measure, LLMs already vastly exceed us.\"). Weird\n\n> And now it's confusing itself for me (referring to something it said as \"your estimate\").

Let me draft the README based on what I've learned:\n\n1. **Audience**: Users first, but broader than MATS - alignment community\n2. **Tone**: Between minimal and friendly, can get more technical toward the bottom\n3. **hive-mind**: Mention briefly\n4. **Planning**: Move to docs/roadmap.md\n5. **Value prop**: Infrastructure for alignment researchers to share knowledge and tools, leveling playing field with larger orgs\n6. **MATS**: Brief context - started at MATS but for broader community\n7. **Sections**: Minimal - About, Installation, Contributing\n8. **Contributing**: Minimal, mention plugin-dev auto-installs, feedback welcome via issues/Slack/etc.\n\nLet me also move the development info from CLAUDE.md - that should probably go in the README or a separate dev doc. Actually, user said \"anything a human might need to see should be in README instead\" - so I should include the dev info.\n\nWait, they said \"minimal\" structure. Let me think about what's essential:\n- About (the value prop)\n- Installation\n- Contributing (including dev info? or separate?)\n\nMaybe:\n- About\n- Installation\n- Contributing\n- Development (for the hive-mind CLI stuff, or link to hive-mind README)\n\nActually, they mentioned \"we can also add nested README files for more technical information on particular plugins (such as hive-mind)\" - so maybe I put the hive-mind CLI dev info in a separate README in the hive-mind plugin folder.\n\nLet me draft:\n\n```markdown\n# alignment-hive\n\nShared infrastructure for alignment researchers. Started at MATS, built for the broader AI safety community.\n\n\n```\n\nI'll focus on crafting a concise, direct README that captures the project's core purpose. The key is to communicate the value proposition quickly and clearly, using a conversational but professional tone. I'll emphasize the collaborative nature of the project and its goal of empowering independent alignment researchers.\n\nThe draft will highlight the main features - the plugin marketplace and hive-mind system - while keeping the language accessible and straightforward. I'll aim to make it inviting for researchers who want to share knowledge and tools across the community.\n\nInstallation instructions will be simple and direct, using code blocks to show exactly how to get started. The contributing section will welcome input and make it clear that collaboration is encouraged.\n\n```","signature":"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"}],"model":"claude-opus-4-5-20251101","stop_reason":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":9,"cache_creation_input_tokens":1362,

CLAUDE.md - minimal and appropriate\n\nOne thing I notice: the roadmap.md is pretty sparse.
