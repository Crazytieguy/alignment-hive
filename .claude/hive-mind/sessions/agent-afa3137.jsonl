I should use efficient tools: Glob for file patterns, Grep for content search, and Read for specific files\n3. I should ignore `.claude/hive-mind/sessions` as it contains logs that would bloat context\n4. I can spawn multiple parallel tool calls for efficiency\n5. I should return absolute file paths and avoid emojis in my responses\n\nThe codebase appears to be an alignment researcher infrastructure project with:\n- A plugin marketplace\n- hive-mind CLI and web app (in `hive-mind/` directory)\n- Plugin distribution in `plugins/` directory\n- Documentation and roadmap\n\nI'm ready to help with any file searches or code analysis you need.
