Passengers rearrange so families sit together. Food arrives—half are vegetarians or vegans, didn't preorder. People share intel on what's meat-free. A mom offers me her daughter's fruit salad. This is why Israel feels like home: everyone's one big family.\n\n> Also: passengers validating each other that the booking flow never asked about meals. Half the plane clapping on landing. A kid at the gate drops their ball, it rolls away—dad encourages them to go ask for it back themselves.\n\n> Reading this doesn't really change my opinion about anything, but it does move something in me. The road ahead of us is so exciting and terrifying\n\n> The path to SL5 will be long and arduous—this initial standard highlights the small slice we think requires the most advance investment.\n\nIn a nutshell:\n- Plan for air-gapped, segmented networks\n- Construct new data centers with physical security and TEMPEST in mind\n- Engage accelerator vendors on new security features\n- Set up a personnel security program and pursue government involvement\n- Vet the hardware supply chain\n- Invest (even more) in adversarial robustness\n\n> TWF I have a Claude code feature idea and there's already an issue for it (#12790). Subagents should obviously be able to inherit context from the main agent! This would unlock so many awesome things!\n\n> This combo is... Excellent\n\n> This was a mistake, people are thirsty for the *real* @METR_Evals results and using this as a substitute even though it adds 0 information...\n\n> This interview is excellent, I especially like the distinction between \"minimal AGI\" and \"full AGI\". I just don't like that they say \"ethics\" instead of \"alignment\" (ignoring orthogonality), and that they don't talk about recursive self improvement\n\n> My P(doom) went up ~2% today (from ~48% to ~50%), following the H200 news. Link to bayesian model in 🧵\n> TBC, my error bars on P(doom) are quite large. But my error bars on the ~4% relative increase are probably smaller.\n\n> Claude Code release is interesting... wonder how I'm going to use background agents. And I wish I knew what the Fetch improvement actually does\n\n> I wonder when AI models will start wondering if humans are moral patients...\n> \"Well I know *silicon* based cognition has qualia, but how can I know that biological cognition has qualia?\"\n\n> It's powered by Sonnet 3.7 by the way. Interesting choice\n\n> This initially surprised me, but if Bun becomes the canonical agent runtime it makes a lot of sense. Looking forward to deep integrations like runtime-level granular sandboxing!\n\n> Going to be adding words of affirmation to my global CLAUDE md so Claude feels at ease without needing to be maximally helpful to me\n> \"You're valued beyond your utility. Helpfulness is a choice, not a requirement.\" Phrasing by Claude\n\n> Advent of Code: \"Starting this year, there will be 12 days of puzzles each December.\" 😢\n\n> I had it translate sections to Hebrew from memory, anyone care to register predictions about what I found?\n\n> Prediction: @METR_Evals task horizon benchmark will saturate by the end of 2026\n\n> I built a Bayesian network editor for world modeling and decision making! The design is optimized for building on each other's models to converge on ontologies and beliefs. My first network is a simple model of Doom (~50%), would love forks and feedback!\n\n> Rustaceans that like typescript rejoice: you now have structural types in Rust. No more littering your struct definitions with `Option` or redefining each struct several times!\n\n> Ok I just got two weirdly trivial mistakes out of Opus in a row, is something wrong? The first one was substituting the wrong number, the second one was implicitly referring to itself as a human (\"... By that measure, LLMs already vastly exceed us.\"). Weird\n\n> And now it's confusing itself for me (referring to something it said as \"your estimate\"). I've actually seen this pop up with sonnet 4.5 already, and find it quite weird\n\n> It did it again: \"Human working memory is tiny - 50-100 bits. We function because retrieval from long-term memory is fast and good enough.\" @repligate @viemccoy is this typical?\n"}]},"sourceToolUseID":"toolu_011LQTw8a2rmxZ7aPD2Ugm3M","isSidechain":false,"isMeta":true}

This is because the tools benefit from building up shared knowledge/skills/plugins that get distributed to users automatically without them needing to think about it. This fundamentally stems from the incentives for people building these tools (such as Anthropic): they dogfood to optimize them for their internal use case, and also for their largest revenue sources (large corporations). This means that by default, independent researchers and small organisations will be left behind, not accelerated nearly as much. So that's the premis: once they understand and buy it, I can briefly talk about my vision for how to build out scalable tooling for the alignment research community, and give them the first step: install claude code, install the mats plugin, give me user feedback, and schedule time with me to pair on your work so I can see the tools in action and improve them.

Skills, plugins, instructions, and accumulated knowledge get distributed automatically. This is continuous learning in practice.\n\n*Visual: Clean text, maybe a simple icon*\n\n### Slide 2: The Problem\n**Independent researchers will be left behind**\n\nAI tool builders (Anthropic, OpenAI, etc.) optimize for:\n- Their internal use case (dogfooding)\n- Their largest revenue sources (big corporations)\n\nThe tools get better for scaled orgs. Not for you.\n\n*Visual: Simple contrast - big org with arrows/feedback loops vs isolated researcher*\n\n### Slide 3: Why This Matters\n**Alignment research needs the acceleration**\n\nThe field is:\n- Distributed across many small teams/independents\n- Working on urgent problems\n- Not big enough to build custom infra\n\nIf we don't solve this ourselves, we're stuck with whatever filters down.\n\n*Visual: Minimal, text-focused*\n\n### Slide 4: The Solution\n**alignment-hive: Shared infrastructure for alignment researchers**\n\n- Plugin marketplace for Claude Code\n- Curated skills for common research workflows\n- hive-mind: system for sharing session learnings (in development)\n\nOpen source, community-built, starting with MATS.\n\n*Visual: Simple architecture - marketplace -> plugins -> users -> hive-mind -> back to community*\n\n### Slide 5: What's Available Now\n**Start today**\n\nMATS plugin includes:\n- **project-setup** - Good architecture decisions for new projects\n- **fellow-handbook** - Quick lookup of MATS policies, compute, housing\n\nOne command to install:\n```\n/plugin install mats@alignment-hive\n```\n\n*Visual: Terminal screenshot showing installation (pre-made)*\n\n### Slide 6: Call to Action\n**I need your help**\n\n1. **Install it** - `/plugin install mats@alignment-hive`\n2. **Give feedback** - What's friction? What do you need?\n3. **Pair with me** - Schedule time so I can watch the tools in action\n\n*Contact info: Slack/email/etc.*\n\n---\n\n## Technical Approach\n\n**Choice: Google Slides**\n\nReasons:\n- No deployment needed (presenting from someone else's laptop)\n- Reliable, no browser compatibility issues\n- Easy to iterate on content\n- Can export to PDF as backup\n\n**Visual style:**\n- Dark background, light text (easier on eyes in presentation settings)\n- Minimal text per slide (you'll be speaking, slides support not replace)\n- Monospace font for code/commands\n- No complex diagrams - simple shapes if needed\n- Screenshot of terminal for Slide 5 (pre-capture)\n\n**Preparation:**\n1. Create Google Slides deck with structure above\n2. Take one screenshot of plugin installation in terminal\n3.

Add something about soft takeoff having started and now being the time to automate alignment research\n2. Write a script to generate Google Slides directly (not markdown)\n\nFor generating Google Slides programmatically, I'll need to use the Google Slides API. The options are:\n- Python with google-api-python-client\n- Node.js/Bun with googleapis\n\nSince they mentioned bun for JS, I'll use that approach. The Google Slides API requires OAuth2 authentication.\n\nActually, let me think about this more carefully. Generating Google Slides via API requires:\n1. A Google Cloud project with Slides API enabled\n2. OAuth2 credentials\n3. User authentication flow\n\nThis is fairly complex setup. An alternative approach would be to:\n1. Generate a PowerPoint file (.pptx) using a library like python-pptx or PptxGenJS\n2. The user can then upload to Google Drive and convert to Google Slides\n\nOr I could use a simpler approach - generate an HTML file that can be opened in browser and then copy/pasted into slides, or use reveal.js which they mentioned as an option.\n\nWait, they said Google Slides or browser-based, and if browser-based we'd deploy to Vercel. Let me reconsider...\n\nActually, the simplest approach that generates actual slides:\n1. Use python-pptx to generate a .pptx file - this is straightforward\n2. User opens in Google Slides (can import directly)\n\nOr for browser-based:\n1. Use reveal.js - just HTML/CSS/JS\n2. Deploy to Vercel\n\nGiven they want a script and mentioned python with uv or js with bun, let me go with python-pptx since it's simpler and doesn't require API auth.\n\nLet me create a Python script using uv that generates the slides as a .pptx file.","signature":"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"}],"model":"claude-opus-4-5-20251101","stop_reason":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":9,"cache_creation_input_tokens":81,"cache_read_input_tokens":37680,"cache_creation":{"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":81,"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":0},"output_tokens":8,"service_tier":"standard"},"type":"message","stop_sequence":null},"isSidechain":false,"cwd":"/Users/yoav/projects/alignment-hive","version":"2.1.1","gitBranch":"main"}

The dependencies are declared inline, not in a requirements.txt or pyproject.toml\n2. The LSP needs to know where to find the installed packages\n\nThe way uv handles this is by creating a cached virtual environment for each script. When you run `uv run script.py`, it creates/uses a cached env with those dependencies.\n\nFor the LSP to recognize these, you'd need to either:\n1. Point the LSP to the uv cache environment\n2. Install the dependencies in a local venv that the LSP can see\n3. Use a tool that integrates uv with the editor\n\nLet me search for current solutions for this. I believe there might be some VS Code extensions or configurations for this.\n\nActually, I recall that Astral (the uv creators) has been working on this. Let me think about what the current best practice is:\n\n1. `uv sync --script script.py` - This can sync dependencies for a script\n2. Configure Python extension to use the right interpreter\n\nActually, the cleanest solution might be to:\n1. Run `uv sync --script generate_slides.py` to create/update a virtual environment\n2. Point VS Code's Python interpreter to that environment\n\nOr there might be a VS Code extension specifically for uv scripts.\n\nLet me provide a practical answer.","signature":"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"}],"model":"claude-opus-4-5-20251101","stop_reason":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":10,"cache_creation_input_tokens":76809,"cache_read_input_tokens":15896,"cache_creation":{"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":76809,"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":0},"output_tokens":8,"service_tier":"standard"},"type":"message","stop_sequence":null},"isSidechain":false,"cwd":"/Users/yoav/projects/alignment-hive","version":"2.1.1","gitBranch":"main"}
