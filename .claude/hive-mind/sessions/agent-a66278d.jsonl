Here's a summary:\n\n## Current State\n\n**alignment-hive** is a brand new repository for building Claude Code infrastructure for AI safety researchers (starting with MATS). It currently contains only documentation files with no code yet.\n\n## Project Goals\n\n1. **Plugin/skills marketplace** - Curated plugins with skills like scholar handbook\n2. **Memory system** - Learning from sessions with simple, non-intrusive design\n3. **Common workflow skills** - Connect to compute, write SRPs, prepare lightning talks, etc.\n\n## Immediate Priority\n\nAccording to the README, the first task is:\n> Create a Claude Code plugin with a simple example skill, validate it works (repo installable as marketplace, plugin auto-updates on changes)\n\n## What's Needed Next\n\nTo proceed with the first immediate step, the next work would involve:\n- Understanding Claude Code's plugin/marketplace format\n- Creating a basic plugin structure\n- Implementing a simple example skill to validate the setup works\n\nThe repository is ready for development but has no code implementation yet. Would you like me to explore anything specific or help plan the first plugin implementation?"}],"model":"claude-opus-4-5-20251101","stop_reason":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":1742,"cache_creation_input_tokens":0,"cache_read_input_tokens":0,"cache_creation":{"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":0,"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":0},"output_tokens":3,"service_tier":"standard"},"type":"message","stop_sequence":null},"isSidechain":true,"cwd":"/Users/yoav/projects/alignment-hive","version":"2.0.76","gitBranch":"main","agentId":"a66278d"}
