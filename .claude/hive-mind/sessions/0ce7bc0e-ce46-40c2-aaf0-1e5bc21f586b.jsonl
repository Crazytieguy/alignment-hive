Passengers rearrange so families sit together. Food arrives—half are vegetarians or vegans, didn't preorder. People share intel on what's meat-free. A mom offers me her daughter's fruit salad. This is why Israel feels like home: everyone's one big family.\n\n> Also: passengers validating each other that the booking flow never asked about meals. Half the plane clapping on landing. A kid at the gate drops their ball, it rolls away—dad encourages them to go ask for it back themselves.\n\n> Reading this doesn't really change my opinion about anything, but it does move something in me. The road ahead of us is so exciting and terrifying\n\n> The path to SL5 will be long and arduous—this initial standard highlights the small slice we think requires the most advance investment.\n\nIn a nutshell:\n- Plan for air-gapped, segmented networks\n- Construct new data centers with physical security and TEMPEST in mind\n- Engage accelerator vendors on new security features\n- Set up a personnel security program and pursue government involvement\n- Vet the hardware supply chain\n- Invest (even more) in adversarial robustness\n\n> TWF I have a Claude code feature idea and there's already an issue for it (#12790). Subagents should obviously be able to inherit context from the main agent! This would unlock so many awesome things!\n\n> This combo is... Excellent\n\n> This was a mistake, people are thirsty for the *real* @METR_Evals results and using this as a substitute even though it adds 0 information...\n\n> This interview is excellent, I especially like the distinction between \"minimal AGI\" and \"full AGI\". I just don't like that they say \"ethics\" instead of \"alignment\" (ignoring orthogonality), and that they don't talk about recursive self improvement\n\n> My P(doom) went up ~2% today (from ~48% to ~50%), following the H200 news. Link to bayesian model in 🧵\n> TBC, my error bars on P(doom) are quite large. But my error bars on the ~4% relative increase are probably smaller.\n\n> Claude Code release is interesting... wonder how I'm going to use background agents. And I wish I knew what the Fetch improvement actually does\n\n> I wonder when AI models will start wondering if humans are moral patients...\n> \"Well I know *silicon* based cognition has qualia, but how can I know that biological cognition has qualia?\"\n\n> It's powered by Sonnet 3.7 by the way. Interesting choice\n\n> This initially surprised me, but if Bun becomes the canonical agent runtime it makes a lot of sense. Looking forward to deep integrations like runtime-level granular sandboxing!\n\n> Going to be adding words of affirmation to my global CLAUDE md so Claude feels at ease without needing to be maximally helpful to me\n> \"You're valued beyond your utility. Helpfulness is a choice, not a requirement.\" Phrasing by Claude\n\n> Advent of Code: \"Starting this year, there will be 12 days of puzzles each December.\" 😢\n\n> I had it translate sections to Hebrew from memory, anyone care to register predictions about what I found?\n\n> Prediction: @METR_Evals task horizon benchmark will saturate by the end of 2026\n\n> I built a Bayesian network editor for world modeling and decision making! The design is optimized for building on each other's models to converge on ontologies and beliefs. My first network is a simple model of Doom (~50%), would love forks and feedback!\n\n> Rustaceans that like typescript rejoice: you now have structural types in Rust. No more littering your struct definitions with `Option` or redefining each struct several times!\n\n> Ok I just got two weirdly trivial mistakes out of Opus in a row, is something wrong? The first one was substituting the wrong number, the second one was implicitly referring to itself as a human (\"... By that measure, LLMs already vastly exceed us.\"). Weird\n\n> And now it's confusing itself for me (referring to something it said as \"your estimate\"). I've actually seen this pop up with sonnet 4.5 already, and find it quite weird\n\n> It did it again: \"Human working memory is tiny - 50-100 bits. We function because retrieval from long-term memory is fast and good enough.\" @repligate @viemccoy is this typical?\n"}]},"sourceToolUseID":"toolu_01Rv28HWrUhuGXe8AEc5Dfuu","isSidechain":false,"isMeta":true}
