This code is displayed to the user along with a verification URL. Once the user completes authentication in their browser, the CLI tool receives the authorization tokens it needs to act on the user's behalf.\n\n### Implementation Steps\n\n1. To begin the authentication flow, your CLI application makes a request to the `/authorize/device` endpoint to obtain the necessary codes and URLs for user authentication.\n\n2. If the user goes to the `verification_uri_complete` (for example, `https://<authkit_domain>/device?user_code=ABCD-EFGH`), they'll need to confirm that the code matches what is displayed in the terminal.\n\n3. While the user is completing authentication in their browser, your CLI application should poll the token endpoint to check for authorization completion. Make requests to the token endpoint using `device_code` from the authorization response.\n\n### Security Considerations\n\nSince command-line applications are distributed to end users, you should avoid embedding the client secret in the app. To make this work, set up your Connect app as a Public application.(no content)Certain types of applications cannot securely store client secrets, such as command-line tools or mobile applications. For these use cases, you can configure an OAuth application as Public.\n\n### Requirements\n\nTo start using CLI Auth, ensure you're using hosted AuthKit (this feature is not available for headless AuthKit implementations).(no content)CLI Auth is also available for Connect applications, allowing you and third-party developers to build CLI tools that integrate with your app's credentials.\n\n\nREMINDER: You MUST include the sources above in your response to the user using markdown hyperlinks."}]},"isSidechain":true,"agentId":"a87f458"}

They released the Stytch CLI, a company hackathon project that puts Stytch API commands right in your terminal with an easy to use interface, helping you ship and manage auth projects faster.\n\n### How Authentication Works\n\nStytch Connected Apps was the backbone of the project, making it easy to authenticate your account from the terminal. By turning their Dashboard into an identity provider with Connected Apps, they ran the exact integration flow developers face when building their own solution.(no content)Using Connected Apps let them quickly turn Stytch into an OIDC-compliant identity provider, so the CLI can mint secure session tokens without making users manually pull and paste their credentials from the Dashboard. And because it uses the PKCE flow, the public binary stays safe—no client secret is ever baked into a developer's machine.\n\n### OAuth Device Code Flow\n\nBy integrating the Stytch Node SDK into their CLI tool, whenever a developer or agent runs a command like `crossmint login`, an OAuth device code flow initiates where the developer signs in via browser. Once verified, the agent is authenticated on their behalf.(no content)Stytch issues a scoped token: With a short lived token, tied to a specific user account, there is no need to copy or paste long-lived secrets.\n\n### Building Your Own CLI with Stytch\n\nFrom this experience, Stytch has put together a guide so that you can start building your own CLI application using Stytch Connected Apps as the authentication service.\n\nThe typical flow involves:\n1. Configuring the CLI app to initiate an authorization flow with PKCE\n2. Users are automatically redirected to the authorization flow in their browser, redirect back to the CLI, and receive a Connected Apps access_token\n3. The access and refresh tokens returned should be stored securely, where other CLI applications or tools cannot access them.\n\n### Installation\n\nYou can install the Stytch CLI easily via NPM, go install, or build it manually from the GitHub repo.\n\n\nREMINDER: You MUST include the sources above in your response to the user using markdown hyperlinks."}]},"isSidechain":true,"agentId":"a87f458"}

This avoids a poor user experience for devices that do not have an easy way to enter text.(no content)Device apps use the Device Authorization Flow (ratified in OAuth 2.0), in which they pass along their Client ID to initiate the authorization process and get a token.\n\n## CLI Implementation Benefits\n\nCLI (Node.js) is a sample implementation of a CLI that uses the Device Authorization Flow instead of the Authorization Code Flow. The major difference is that your CLI does not need to host a webserver and listen on a port.(no content)The device authorization flow is the most secure way for CLIs, and thanks to Auth0 it is also easy to integrate with the full power of Universal Login.\n\n## How It Works\n\nThe Device Authorization Flow contains two different paths; one occurs on the device requesting authorization and the other occurs in a browser. The browser flow path, wherein a device code is bound to the session in the browser, occurs in parallel to part of the device flow path.\n\nThe process involves:\n1. The user starts the app on the device. The device app requests authorization from the Auth0 Authorization Server using its Client ID (/oauth/device/code endpoint).\n2. The user visits the verification_uri on their computer, enters the user_code and confirms that the device that is being activated is displaying the user_code.\n3. When the user successfully completes the browser flow path, your Auth0 Authorization Server responds with an Access Token (and optionally, a Refresh Token).\n\n## Setup Requirements\n\nRegister a Native Application. Ensure the OIDC Conformant toggle is enabled. Add Device Code to the Application's grant types. For more information, read Update Grant Types.(no content)Add Refresh Token to the Application's grant types if you want to enable Refresh Tokens. Configure and enable at least one connection for the application. Register your API with Auth0.\n\n## Sample Implementation\n\nAuth0 provides an official sample on GitHub:\n- This sample demonstrates how to add authentication to a Node.js CLI with Auth0 Device Authorization Grant.\n- Rename .env.example to .env and replace the values for AUTH0_CLIENT_ID, AUTH0_DOMAIN with your Auth0 credentials.\n\n## Python CLI Example\n\nA CLI can authenticate a user using device flow and, upon completing the authentication process, extract information about the user and display it on the screen.(no content)While the user accesses the URL and completes the authentication flow, the CLI will continuously check with Auth0's API for the status of the process. Because the authentication flow occurs outside the scope of the application, maybe even on a different device, polling the API is used to determine when the user completes the request.\n\n## Additional Resources\n\n- There is an open-sourced Go module to perform the device authorization flow (github.com/rockset/device-authorization). It supports both Auth0 and Okta as OAuth providers.\n\n\nREMINDER: You MUST include the sources above in your response to the user using markdown hyperlinks."}]},"isSidechain":true,"agentId":"a87f458"}

Traditional approaches, such as storing API keys in configuration files or environment variables, pose security risks and lead to poor user experiences.\n\n## OAuth Device Flow (Device Authorization Grant)\n\nThe OAuth 2.0 Device Authorization Grant, commonly referred to as the Device Flow, is an extension to the original OAuth 2.0 specification. It solves the problem of obtaining access tokens on devices that do not have a browser or have limited input capabilities.\n\n### How It Works\n\nWhen a user initiates authentication, the CLI requests a device code from your AuthKit instance. This code is displayed to the user along with a verification URL. Once the user completes authentication in their browser, the CLI tool receives the authorization tokens it needs to act on the user's behalf.\n\n### Key Components\n\nThe flow involves several key components: Device Authorization Endpoint (where the device requests authorization), User Code (displayed to the user to enter on a secondary device), Verification URI (the URL the user visits to input the code and authenticate), and Device Code (used by the device to poll the token endpoint).\n\n## Real-World Usage\n\nReal-world example: the official GitHub command line tool, gh uses this pattern to authenticate users, and the AWS CLI uses device code flow when a browser is not available.(no content)CLI tools are common now and are provided from many services (ex: Azure, Heroku, Firebase, etc) and these services generally need you to log in through the CLI. This flow is currently used in the Azure CLI.\n\n## Best Practices by Use Case\n\n**Developer tools & SDKs:** Browser-based OAuth flows provide the ideal balance of security and usability. They leverage existing auth systems, support SSO/SAML integration, and offer a familiar user experience.(no content)**CI/CD & automation:** Temporary tokens with strict scoping and automatic rotation minimize risk while enabling automated workflows.(no content)**Enterprise deployments:** Device code flow combines the security benefits of OAuth with the flexibility to authenticate from any environment, including containers and headless systems.\n\n## Security Considerations\n\nAuth0 does not recommend using the Resource Owner Password Grant (ROPG) flow for native applications. In the IETF article, RFC 8252 OAuth 2.0 for Native Apps, it is recommended that \"OAuth 2.0 authorization request from native apps should ONLY be made through external user-agents, primarily the user's browser.\"(no content)One thing the device flow doesn't protect against is an attacker with a foothold on the computer that executes the CLI. They can wait until the user has completed authentication and then act as the user for the duration of the access token. To mitigate this risk, you can require a one-time password (OTP), such as a Yubikey, every time the user performs a privileged action.\n\n## Container Security\n\nThe device code flow displays a code you enter in a browser on any device, making it perfect for containers where you can't open a browser directly. A common but dangerous mistake is embedding credentials directly in your Docker image.\n\n## 2025 Updates\n\nIn June 2025, WorkOS launched CLI Authentication for AuthKit, bringing OAuth 2.0 Device Authorization Grant Flow to hosted AuthKit customers. This feature enables users to securely authenticate command-line applications using the same trusted AuthKit experience they are familiar with from web apps.(no content)With the rise of AI-powered CLI tools (Claude Code, Codex CLI, Block Goose, Mistral Vibe CLI, etc.), there's growing demand for seamless CLI authentication without manual token handling.\n\n\nREMINDER: You MUST include the sources above in your response to the user using markdown hyperlinks."}]},"isSidechain":true,"agentId":"a87f458"}

User Management and Authentication are free up to 1 million MAUs and $2,500/mo for each additional million MAUs.\n\n### Pricing Tiers\nWorkOS has 3 pricing editions, from $49 to $499.\n\n### Per-Connection Pricing (SSO & Directory Sync)\nWorkOS SSO baseline is $125 per connection/month.(no content)WorkOS Directory Sync is $125 per connection/month.(no content)Each enterprise customer you support with SSO or Directory Sync is counted as one connection.(no content)Each connection at WorkOS is billed the same, regardless of the identity provider (IdP), directory service used, or the total number of end users.\n\n### Considerations for Small Teams\nEach enterprise connection adds $125+ monthly cost. Small startups find this pricing structure hard.(no content)WorkOS prices SSO/SCIM per connection. If you have many tenant orgs with modest usage, per-connection costs can add up quickly; with few orgs and large user counts, per-connection may be cheaper. Model both to find your break-even.\n\n### Annual Cost Estimates\nThe maximum price for WorkOS software is around $80,000. On average, the annual cost for WorkOS is about $21,000.\n\n### Pricing Model\nWorkOS generally offers more transparent and predictable pricing compared to some legacy identity providers, with clear costs per connection for key features and automatic volume discounts.\n\nFor small teams, WorkOS's free tier for authentication (up to 1M MAUs) can be very attractive, but if you need enterprise SSO or Directory Sync features, the per-connection pricing model of $125/month per enterprise customer connection is important to factor into your budget planning.\n\n\nREMINDER: You MUST include the sources above in your response to the user using markdown hyperlinks."}]},"isSidechain":true,"agentId":"a87f458"}

Users can be added to the application through invitations, enterprise connections or manual user creation. This mode is ideal for applications that are in private beta or internal tools.\n\nTo enable this mode:\nIn the Clerk Dashboard, navigate to the Restrictions page. Toggle on \"Enable restricted mode\" and select Save.\n\nWhen restricted mode is enabled:\n- The `<SignIn />` component will keep the prompt to sign up hidden by default. This is to avoid confusion for users who don't have access.\n- The `<SignUp />` is accessible only to users who have been invited and have a valid invitation link. Users who don't have access will see a message indicating that they need an invitation to sign up.\n\n### Allowlist Feature\nBy adding specific identifiers to the allowlist, only users with those identifiers will be able to sign up to your application, while others will be blocked. This is useful for internal tools, where you want to allow only users with your company domain to have access to the application. After creating an account, users cannot change their identifier to bypass the allowlist, making this feature a secure way to control who can access your application.(no content)For example, if you add clerk.dev as an allowed email domain, any user with a @clerk.dev email address can sign up for your application.(no content)This feature requires a paid plan for production use, but all features are free to use in development mode so that you can try out what works for you.\n\n### Invitations\nInvitations are only used to invite users to your application. The application will still be available to everyone even without an invitation. If you're looking to restrict access to invited users only, refer to the Restricted sign-up mode.(no content)You can create an invitation either in the Clerk Dashboard or programmatically. When making this decision, keep in mind that if you create an invitation through the Clerk Dashboard, you can only set an invitation expiration date. If you create an invitation programmatically, you are able to set more options, such as the URL you want the user to be redirected to after they accept the invitation, metadata to add to the invitation, or whether an invitation should be created if there is already an existing invitation for the given email address.\n\n### Waitlist Mode\nIf you're using Next.js, the `<Waitlist />` component is available in @clerk/nextjs@6.2.0 and above. In Waitlist mode, users can register their interest in your app by joining a waitlist.(no content)As of Nov 2024, Clerk now has a built-in waitlist feature that you can use.\n\n### Allowlist & Blocklist Priority\nIn the case that you have enabled the allowlist and the blocklist and have added the same identifier in both, the allowlist takes precedence.\n\n### Recent Changes\nFor new applications created after August 5, 2025, the allowlist and blocklist will only apply to sign ups. Previously, these lists affected both sign ups and sign ins.\n\n\nREMINDER: You MUST include the sources above in your response to the user using markdown hyperlinks."}]},"isSidechain":true,"agentId":"a87f458"}

You can try it out in your staging environment with the provided test credentials.\n\n### Key Features:\n- WorkOS provides a default GitHub Client ID and Client Secret combination, which allows you to quickly enable and test GitHub OAuth. You can use the WorkOS API to initiate SSO by setting the provider parameter to GitHubOAuth.\n- The default credentials are only intended for testing and therefore only available in the Staging environment. For your production environment, you need to create and specify your own GitHub Client ID and Client Secret.\n- WorkOS will request the OAuth scopes that are required for authentication by default, and you can optionally configure your integration to request additional OAuth scopes as needed.\n\n## Pricing\n\nThe search results don't provide specific pricing details for the GitHub OAuth connector itself. However:\n\nWorkOS offers transparent pricing that scales with your growth, with organization-based pricing for SSO, Directory Sync, Audit Logs, and more.(no content)According to a third-party source, WorkOS specializes in Enterprise SSO, charging $125 per month per SAML connection.\n\nFor complete and up-to-date pricing information specific to the GitHub OAuth connector, I recommend visiting the [WorkOS pricing page](https://workos.com/pricing) directly, as OAuth providers like GitHub may have different pricing than enterprise SAML connections.\n\n\nREMINDER: You MUST include the sources above in your response to the user using markdown hyperlinks."}]},"isSidechain":true,"agentId":"a87f458"}

Long-lived tokens increase the risk of unauthorized access, especially if an old token is leaked or mishandled.(no content)You can automate the token rotation process using CI/CD pipelines or scheduled tasks that securely store and replace tokens in the environment without manual intervention. During rotation, update the application's configuration with the new credentials to avoid downtime.(no content)Auth0 also recommends reviewing and revoking old credentials that are no longer in use to minimize exposure.\n\n### CLI/Programmatic Use Cases\nThere's community interest in Personal Access Tokens for granting users access to the API without requiring a typical login flow. This is useful for programmatic settings where a typical login flow would not make sense - similar to how GitHub generates personal access tokens which can be used to access the API and can be revoked.(no content)For CLI applications, users building applications that interface with CI/CD SaaS offerings need API access protected by authentication, where a script sends requests to API endpoints during builds.\n\n### Scoped Access Tokens\nWhen integrating with the Auth0 Management API, request scoped access tokens to restrict permissions to only what your application requires. Scoped access tokens improve security by limiting each token's capabilities to specific operations needed, such as create:users, read:users, or update:users.\n\n\nREMINDER: You MUST include the sources above in your response to the user using markdown hyperlinks."}]},"isSidechain":true,"agentId":"a87f458"}

This makes webhooks seem \"real-time\", but it's important to note that they are asynchronous.\n\n## User Signup Events\n\nFor user-related events, you can subscribe to: user.created, user.updated, and user.deleted.(no content)To trigger the user.created event, create a new user in your app.\n\n## Use Cases for User Signup Webhooks\n\nWhile Clerk's own database acts as the primary source of truth for authentication and user management, you can create a copy of this data in your own database which gets updated asynchronously through webhooks. This allows you to query your own database for user data instead of relying on Clerk's APIs, along with flexibility with the data model, complex queries, transactional guarantees, and real time behavior.(no content)Some advanced use cases might rely on asynchronous workflows and background jobs, such as sending notifications to users or other external systems. These workflows can be triggered to execute when a webhook event is received, for example, sending new users an onboarding email to your application, or subscribing them to mailing lists for software updates and promotional campaigns.\n\n## Important Considerations\n\nWebhook deliveries are not guaranteed and may occasionally fail due to problems like network issues, so your implementation should be prepared to handle retries and error scenarios. Additionally, syncing data via webhooks is eventually consistent, meaning there can be a delay between when a Clerk event occurs and when the corresponding data is reflected in your database. If not managed carefully, this delay can introduce bugs and race conditions.\n\n## Security\n\nTo ensure that the API route receiving the webhook can only be hit by your app, you should verify the request signature. Svix webhook requests are signed and can be verified to ensure the request is not malicious. To verify the signature, use Clerk's verifyWebhook helper.\n\n**Note:** The search results didn't return specific pricing information for Clerk webhooks. Webhooks are typically included as part of Clerk's authentication service plans. For detailed pricing information, I'd recommend checking Clerk's official pricing page directly at clerk.com/pricing.\n\n\nREMINDER: You MUST include the sources above in your response to the user using markdown hyperlinks."}]},"isSidechain":true,"agentId":"a87f458"}

You may add any additional GitHub API scopes as a space-separated list in the `custom_scopes` query parameter.(no content)Once the user successfully authenticates with GitHub, they'll be redirected to the redirect URL provided at the start of the OAuth flow with a Stytch OAuth token.(no content)GitHub OAuth can be used with Discovery authentication, a centralized login flow that enables users to quickly find and access all their associated organizations. By managing GitHub scopes and access, you can enable a wide range of integrations with GitHub's API.\n\n### B2C React Example (Google OAuth, not GitHub)\n\nStytch's React SDK provides pre-built UI components, useful React hooks, and headless methods to securely interact with Stytch. The example application features Email Magic Links and OAuth.(no content)The B2C React example specifically features Email Magic Link and Google OAuth authentication powered by Stytch - note that this example uses Google OAuth rather than GitHub OAuth.\n\n### Step-Up Authentication for GitHub OAuth\n\nIf the tenant ID of the provider matches a tenant ID in the organization's Allowed Tenants, the end user will be fully authenticated after completing an OAuth flow. If the tenant ID does not match any of the Allowed Tenants, an end user wishing to authenticate using Slack, HubSpot, or GitHub as identity providers may be required to do a \"step-up\" form of primary authentication.\n\n### Getting Started\n\nIf you are using Slack, HubSpot, or GitHub as OAuth providers, you can allow JIT Provisioning to the Organization by tenant ID.(no content)When configuring, it's recommended to click the \"Setting up OAuth with [provider]\" button to streamline the configuration of your OAuth client. Be sure to add the Stytch redirect URI to your provider OAuth setup as an authorized redirect URI.\n\nThe search results indicate that GitHub OAuth is primarily documented for Stytch's B2B authentication product. For B2C use cases, the example applications mainly showcase Google OAuth rather than GitHub OAuth integration.\n\n\nREMINDER: You MUST include the sources above in your response to the user using markdown hyperlinks."}]},"isSidechain":true,"agentId":"a87f458"}

For frontend SDKs, you'll use your public_token rather than your project_id and secret when communicating with the Stytch API.(no content)Each Stytch Project has 1 Live environment and 1 Test environment by default. You can create additional test environments in the Stytch Dashboard. Each environment has a distinct Project ID, Secret, and Public token. Test environments access the https://test.stytch.com API while Live environments access the https://api.stytch.com API. The Stytch API keys and data resources are all scoped to an environment and are not shared between environments.\n\n### OAuth-Based Revocable Tokens (Connected Apps)\nStytch advocates for OAuth over static API keys for managing access, particularly for AI agent integrations:\n\nRather than handing an agent a raw API key, they've come to rely on standard OAuth flows so users can explicitly authorize the agent to act on their behalf. Whether that agent is accessing calendar data or initiating financial operations, OAuth provides a standard and highly-secure way to issue scoped, revocable tokens.\n\n### Key Benefits of Revocable Tokens\n\nUnlike static API keys that can live for years, OAuth 2.0 access tokens often expire in an hour, dramatically reducing the window for an attacker if one is leaked. Refresh tokens allow agents to get new access tokens without the user having to log in again, and users or admins can immediately revoke these tokens whenever they need to.(no content)The user (or their organization's administrator) can go to their \"Connected Apps\" settings at any time and click \"Disconnect.\" This immediately invalidates the agent's token, cutting off its access.\n\n### Stytch Connected Apps Features\n\nWith Connected Apps, Stytch handles all the heavy lifting by implementing OAuth 2.0/OIDC flows end-to-end, managing token issuance, validation, and revocation, and ensuring strict compliance with RFC 6749, security best practices, and session integrity.(no content)Stytch Connected Apps can manage JWT issuance, provide JWKS endpoints, rotate refresh tokens, and allow for instant revocation, so developers can focus on logic while leaving lifecycle enforcement to the identity layer.\n\n### Session Token Revocation\n\nStytch's JWT support allows you to mint JWTs that can be verified without needing to hit Stytch's API. This allows for highly performant authorization for your product when you need it, while also providing the control to revoke access when and where you want it.(no content)Session tokens are a session management solution that stores the token on the server-side, along with user data. Session tokens are verified against the server's database with every user request, and a single token can be easily revoked at any time. This results in higher latency than JWTs. However, when control over session revocation is critical, this solution can be beneficial since it guarantees instant session revocation when needed.\n\n\nREMINDER: You MUST include the sources above in your response to the user using markdown hyperlinks."}]},"isSidechain":true,"agentId":"a87f458"}

In the Clerk Dashboard, navigate to the SSO connections page and select Add connection and select \"For all users.\"\n\n2. In the left sidenav of your GitHub's Developer Settings, select OAuth Apps, then select \"New OAuth app.\" You'll be redirected to the Register a new OAuth app page. Complete the required fields, and in Authorization Callback URL, paste the Authorization Callback URL you saved from the Clerk Dashboard, then select \"Register application.\"\n\n3. Select \"Generate a new client secret\" and save the Client ID and Client Secret somewhere secure.\n\n4. Navigate back to the Clerk Dashboard where the modal should still be open. Paste the Client ID and Client Secret values that you saved into the respective fields and select \"Add connection.\"\n\n### Accessing User Data via OAuth Access Token\n\nYou can retrieve the corresponding OAuth access token for a user that has previously authenticated with a particular OAuth provider using the `getUserOauthAccessToken()` function, which takes a userId (string) and provider parameter.(no content)Example usage: `const response = await clerkClient.users.getUserOauthAccessToken(userId, provider)`. You can use this method to retrieve a social provider's OAuth access token, enabling access to user data from both the provider and Clerk.\n\n### Adding Additional OAuth Scopes for GitHub\n\nOAuth scopes can be used to access additional user data from the provider. To add additional OAuth scopes, when you are enabling a new social connection, enable \"Use custom credentials\" and the Scopes field will appear.(no content)Clerk allows you to request additional OAuth scopes even after a user has signed up. Pass the `additionalOAuthScopes` prop to the `<UserProfile/>` or `<UserButton />` component, with any additional OAuth scope you would like per provider. The user will be prompted to reconnect their account on their user profile page.\n\nFor example:\n```jsx\n<UserButton userProfileProps={{\n  additionalOAuthScopes: {\n    github: ['qux'],\n  },\n}}/>\n```\n\nYou can use a social provider's OAuth access token to access user data from that provider in addition to their data from Clerk.\n\nTo access the GitHub username specifically, you would need to use the OAuth access token obtained via `getUserOauthAccessToken()` and then call GitHub's API to retrieve the user's profile information, including their username.\n\n\nREMINDER: You MUST include the sources above in your response to the user using markdown hyperlinks."}]},"isSidechain":true,"agentId":"a87f458"}

The API may change before general availability.\n\n### Key Features\n\nThe API keys feature offers:\n- **Instant revocation** — API keys use opaque tokens (not JWTs), enabling immediate invalidation\n- **Scopes** — Define exactly what each key can access\n- **Custom claims** — Store additional metadata on keys (backend SDK only)\n- **Optional expiration** — Set TTL or keep keys long-lived(no content)Clerk's API keys feature allows your application's users to create API keys that can delegate access to your application's API on their behalf. API keys are typically long-lived tokens associated with a user or organization that provide access to a set of API endpoints for third-party services.\n\n### Pricing\n\nAPI keys are free to use during the beta period. After general availability, they'll move to a simple usage-based pricing model.(no content)Billing isn't live yet — Clerk will provide at least 30 days' notice before billing begins. They'll also provide usage stats and monitoring in the Dashboard before then, so you'll have complete visibility over your usage and costs.\n\n### How It Works\n\nAPI Keys are now available in public beta, bringing comprehensive machine authentication capabilities into your applications with zero additional code required. When you enable API keys in the Clerk Dashboard, an API Keys tab automatically appears in your `<UserProfile />` and `<OrganizationProfile />` components, allowing your users to create, view, and revoke their API keys seamlessly.(no content)You can enable API keys for users, organizations, or both depending on your application's needs.\n\n### Revocation\n\nAPI keys are long-lived, opaque tokens that can be instantly revoked.(no content)You can revoke API keys programmatically using the Backend SDK with an optional revocation reason for your records. This will revoke the API key and prevent it from being used to authenticate any future requests.(no content)If the API keys feature is disabled in the Dashboard, any existing keys will fail verification but will not be revoked.\n\n\nREMINDER: You MUST include the sources above in your response to the user using markdown hyperlinks."}]},"isSidechain":true,"agentId":"a87f458"}

This ensures you are not charged for users who sign up, but churn within their first day and do not return.(no content)Users are considered \"active\" when they log into your application multiple times in a single month after the first day. You are only billed for users that are considered active.(no content)Organizations are considered \"active\" when they have more than one active user in that organization at any time in a single month. Like users, you are only billed for active organizations.\n\n### Free Plan Included Features\nThe free plan includes:\n- No credit card required\n- 10,000 monthly active users (MAUs) included free\n- 100 monthly active organizations (MAOs) included free\n- No charge for users who sign up but never return (\"First Day Free\")\n- Pre-built components\n- Custom domain\n- 3 dashboard seats included\n- Additional seats cost $10/mo per seat\n- Many authentication, security, and admin features\n\n### Pro Plan (Paid)\nThe Pro plan includes all Free plan features plus additional Pro features with a base price of $25 per month and usage pricing of $0.02 per additional MAU (first 10,000 MAUs are free). For B2B, it's $1 per additional MAO (first 100 MAOs are free).(no content)The Pro plan also includes the ability to set a \"Custom Session Duration.\"\n\n### Pro Add-Ons\nPro add-ons include Enhanced Organizations (which includes domain restrictions and custom roles and permissions) and Enhanced Administration.\n\n### Exceeding Free Tier Limits\nOnce you exceed 10,000 monthly active users or 100 organizations, you will be required to upgrade to the Pro tier, where each user or organization beyond the free tier allowance will be added to your monthly bill. You'll be given a one-month grace period so your application can continue to operate correctly.\n\n### Development Testing\nAll pro features are available to try in the development instance of your application, allowing you to test the full functionality of Clerk without being constrained by a traditional trial period. All features are properly tagged in the Dashboard so you'll know if a specific feature requires an upgrade to use in production.\n\n\nREMINDER: You MUST include the sources above in your response to the user using markdown hyperlinks."}]},"isSidechain":true,"agentId":"a87f458"}
