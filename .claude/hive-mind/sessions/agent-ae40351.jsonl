In the left sidenav of your GitHub's Developer Settings, select OAuth Apps. Select New OAuth app. You'll be redirected to the Register a new OAuth app page.\n2. Complete the required fields. In Authorization Callback URL, paste the Authorization Callback URL you saved from the Clerk Dashboard. Select Register application.\n3. Select Generate a new client secret. Save the Client ID and Client Secret somewhere secure.\n\n**In Clerk Dashboard:**\n1. Navigate back to the Clerk Dashboard where the modal should still be open. Paste the Client ID and Client Secret values that you saved into the respective fields. Select Add connection.\n2. If the modal or page is no longer open, navigate to the SSO connections page in the Clerk Dashboard. Select the connection. Under Use custom credentials, paste the values into their respective fields.\n\n### Testing Your Connection\nThe simplest way to test your connection is to visit your Clerk app's Account Portal, which is available for all Clerk apps out-of-the-box.\n\n### Additional Features\n\nSocial connections, also known as OAuth connections in Clerk, allow users to gain access to your application by using their existing credentials from an Identity Provider (IdP), like Google or Microsoft. For example, if you enable Google as a social provider, then when a user wants to sign in to your application, they can select Google and use their Google account to sign in.(no content)When using social connections, the sign-up and sign-in flows are equivalent. If a user doesn't have an account and tries to sign in, an account will be made for them, and vice versa.\n\n### Connecting OAuth After Authentication\nFor example, say your application wants to read a user's GitHub repository data but doesn't want to allow the user to authenticate with their GitHub account. The user can sign up with their email and password, or whatever authentication method you choose, and then afterwards, connect their GitHub account to your application through their user profile.(no content)The easiest way to enable this for your users is by using the `<UserProfile />` component.\n\n### Additional OAuth Scopes\nClerk allows you to request additional OAuth scopes even after a user has signed up. Pass the `additionalOAuthScopes` prop to the `<UserProfile/>` or `<UserButton />` component, with any additional OAuth scope you would like per provider.\n\n\nREMINDER: You MUST include the sources above in your response to the user using markdown hyperlinks."}]},"isSidechain":true,"agentId":"ae40351"}

If a user doesn't have an account and tries to sign in, an account will be made for them, and vice versa.\n\n### Custom OAuth Flows\nWith OAuth flows, it's common for users to try to sign in with an OAuth provider, but they don't have a Clerk account for your app yet. Clerk automatically transfers the flow from the SignIn object to the SignUp object, which returns the \"missing_requirements\" status and missingFields array needed to handle the missing requirements flow.\n\nThe search results show how to enable GitHub OAuth in Clerk, but don't specifically show how to **force** GitHub as the only/required authentication method. You would typically configure this in the Clerk Dashboard by enabling only GitHub OAuth and disabling other authentication methods (like email/password) in the Sign-up and Sign-in options settings.\n\n\nREMINDER: You MUST include the sources above in your response to the user using markdown hyperlinks."}]},"isSidechain":true,"agentId":"ae40351"}

Once you create an invitation, Clerk sends an email to the invited user with a unique invitation link.(no content)You can create an invitation either in the Clerk Dashboard or programmatically. When making this decision, keep in mind that if you create an invitation through the Clerk Dashboard, you can only set an invitation expiration date. If you create an invitation programmatically, you are able to set more options, such as the URL you want the user to be redirected to after they accept the invitation, metadata to add to the invitation, or whether an invitation should be created if there is already an existing invitation for the given email address.\n\n### Accepting Invitations\n\nOnce the user visits the invitation link and is redirected to the specified URL, the query parameter `__clerk_ticket` will be appended to the URL. This query parameter contains the invitation token.(no content)You can use the `useOrganizationList()` hook to get `userInvitations`, which is a list of the user's Organization invitations. `userInvitations` is an object with data that contains an array of `UserOrganizationInvitation` objects. Each `UserOrganizationInvitation` object has an `accept()` method that accepts the invitation to the Organization.\n\n### Organization Invitations\n\nOrganization members with appropriate permissions can invite new users to their organization and manage those invitations. The invitation recipient can be either an existing user of your application or a new user. If they are a new user, they will need to sign up in order to accept the invitation.(no content)New organization invitations get a \"pending\" status until they are revoked by an organization administrator or accepted by the invitee. The request body supports passing an optional `redirect_url` parameter. When the invited user clicks the link to accept the invitation, they will be redirected to the URL you provided. Use this parameter to implement a custom invitation acceptance flow.\n\n### Invitation Metadata\n\nMetadata can be attached to the newly created invitation. The value of this property should be a well-formed JSON object. Once the user accepts the invitation and signs up, these metadata will end up in the user's public metadata.\n\n### Expiration\n\nInvitations expire after a month. If the user clicks on an expired invitation, they will get redirected to the application's sign-up page and will have to go through the normal sign-up flow. Their email address will not be auto-verified.\n\nNote: The search results don't specifically mention webhooks for invitation acceptance events. If you need information about Clerk webhooks specifically for invitation events, you may want to check Clerk's webhooks documentation directly, as this may involve events like `organizationInvitation.accepted` or similar webhook triggers.\n\n\nREMINDER: You MUST include the sources above in your response to the user using markdown hyperlinks."}]},"isSidechain":true,"agentId":"ae40351"}

This makes webhooks seem \"real-time\", but it's important to note that they are asynchronous.\n\n### Webhook Payload Structure\n\nThe payload of a webhook is a JSON object that contains a `data` property with the actual payload sent by Clerk. The payload can be a different object depending on the event type. For example, for `user.*` events, the payload will always be the User object.\n\nThe webhook payload includes properties like:\n- `email_addresses`\n- `external_accounts` (for OAuth connections)\n- `public_metadata` and `private_metadata`\n- User profile information (name, image, etc.)\n\n### Key User Events\n\nThe `user.created` event triggers when a new user registers in the app or is created via the Clerk Dashboard or Backend API. Listening to this event allows the initial insertion of user information in your database.(no content)The `user.deleted` event triggers when a user deletes their account, or their account is removed via the Clerk Dashboard or Backend API. Listening to this event allows you to delete the user from your database or add a `deleted: true` flag.\n\n### OAuth and Webhooks\n\nOne user reported using Clerk for user authentication with a webhook set up to capture `user.created` events to persist user data in a MongoDB database. However, they experienced issues with the webhook not being triggered when a user signed up with a Google OAuth account.(no content)When using Clerk OAuth for user authentication, detecting new user registrations from the web app can be challenging. To address this, webhooks can be used to automatically send user data to a database upon signup.\n\n### Webhook Verification\n\nTo ensure that the API route receiving the webhook can only be hit by your app, Svix webhook requests are signed and can be verified to ensure the request is not malicious. To verify the signature, use Clerk's `verifyWebhook` helper.(no content)Clerk uses Svix to send signed webhook requests.\n\n### Setting Up Webhooks\n\nYou need to add an endpoint in Clerk's Webhooks to inform Clerk to send notifications to this endpoint when a user's information changes. Fill in your project URL in the endpoint (e.g., `https://your-project.com/api/webhooks/clerk`), then subscribe to events by checking the user events (`user.created`, `user.deleted`, `user.updated`) and click create.\n\n### Best Practices\n\nSyncing data with webhooks can be a suitable approach for some applications, but it comes with important considerations. Webhook deliveries are not guaranteed and may occasionally fail due to problems like network issues, so your implementation should be prepared to handle retries and error scenarios. Additionally, syncing data via webhooks is eventually consistent, meaning there can be a delay between when a Clerk event occurs and when the corresponding data is reflected in your database.\n\n\nREMINDER: You MUST include the sources above in your response to the user using markdown hyperlinks."}]},"isSidechain":true,"agentId":"ae40351"}

Here's what I found:\n\n## Clerk Webhook Organization Invitation Events\n\nClerk webhooks allow you to receive event notifications from Clerk.(no content)Clerk webhooks allow you to receive event notifications from Clerk, such as when a user is created or updated. When an event occurs, Clerk will send an HTTP POST request to your webhook endpoint configured for the event type.\n\n### Key Events for Organization Invitations\n\nBased on the code example from a Threads app implementation, there are several relevant webhook events:\n\n1. **`organizationInvitation.created`** - This event is triggered when an invitation is created. The code shows handling for `if (eventType === \"organizationInvitation.created\")`.\n\n2. **`organizationMembership.created`** - This event listens for organization membership creation, which is described as \"(member invite & accepted)\" - meaning when a member is added through an accepted invitation. This is the event that fires when an invitation is accepted and the user joins the organization.\n\n3. **`organizationMembership.deleted`** - This event listens for member deletion when a member is removed from the organization.\n\n### Important Note on Invitation Acceptance\n\nThere doesn't appear to be a specific `organizationInvitation.accepted` event. Instead, when an invitation is accepted, the `organizationMembership.created` event is triggered, which represents the new membership being created as a result of the accepted invitation.\n\n### Invitation Status\n\nThe status of an organization invitation can be: `'pending' | 'accepted' | 'revoked'`.(no content)New organization invitations get a \"pending\" status until they are revoked by an organization administrator or accepted by the invitee.\n\n### Webhook Payload\n\nThe payload of a webhook is a JSON object that contains a `data` property with the actual payload sent by Clerk. The payload can be a different object depending on the event type.\n\nTo view the complete event catalog, you can navigate to the Webhooks page in the Clerk Dashboard and select the Event Catalog tab.\n\n\nREMINDER: You MUST include the sources above in your response to the user using markdown hyperlinks."}]},"isSidechain":true,"agentId":"ae40351"}

On the REST endpoint for users, MS external accounts have `provider` and `provider_user_id`, but Google external accounts have `google_id` with no provider.\n\n### Accessing User Data from OAuth Providers\n\nAn array of all the ExternalAccount objects associated with the user via OAuth is available through `externalAccounts`.(no content)You can add an external account for a user using `createExternalAccount()`. A new ExternalAccount will be created and associated with the user. This method is useful if you want to allow an already signed-in user to connect their account with an external provider, such as Facebook, GitHub, etc.\n\n### Getting OAuth Access Tokens\n\nYou can retrieve the corresponding OAuth access token for a user that has previously authenticated with a particular OAuth provider using `getUserOauthAccessToken(userId, provider)`.(no content)You can use a social provider's OAuth access token to access user data from that provider in addition to their data from Clerk. Use the `getUserOauthAccessToken()` method to get the user's OAuth access token.\n\n\nREMINDER: You MUST include the sources above in your response to the user using markdown hyperlinks."}]},"isSidechain":true,"agentId":"ae40351"}
