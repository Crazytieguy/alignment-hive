This will be disbursed in two parts: half at the beginning and half at the end of the main MATS program. The second half of the grant is prorated based on the number of weeks fellows participate in the program.\n\nMATS participants may have to pay taxes on their grants based on the rules of the countries where they are a resident for tax purposes. The grants should be regarded as \"private grants from a non-profit entity (i.e., [AI Safety Support](https://www.aisafetysupport.org/) and not MATS) provided to individuals for independent research and participation in a US-based seminar program.\" While fellow grants are provided by [AI Safety Support](https://www.aisafetysupport.org/) and not [Effective Ventures](https://ev.org/), fellows may find [this tax advice](https://funds.effectivealtruism.org/help/1lZgor0q3CImJwTt0xefPR) helpful.\n\n## Training Materials\n\n### Mentor Curriculum\n\nSome mentors have developed a training curriculum for their fellows. Fellows are expected to carefully read through their mentor’s assigned curriculum and explore any disagreements or confusion in their weekly mentor meetings. If you have already thoroughly read any mentor curriculum elements prior to the start of the program, or find that you are progressing faster than expected, please reach out to your mentor for more advanced reading material.\n\n## Research Phase Overview (Jan 5 - March 28)\n\n### Commitment\n\nThe default time frame for this program phase is 40hrs/week during Jan 5 - March 28, but these dates are flexible. For example, some fellows may choose to do part-time for some weeks to accommodate school commitments. Please contact a member of the MATS team or email exec@matsprogram.org if you would like alternative program dates or weekly commitments.\n\nBy default, we expect fellows to complete this program in-person in our Berkeley, California offices, with some exceptions of fellows who will complete the program from London, UK. Accommodation will also be provided in Berkeley; housing will be co-located with the office for convenience. We will also try to tailor accommodations to your preferences, e.g., for greater work-home separation. Please contact a member of the MATS team or email kali@matsprogram.org if you require any support.\n\n### Milestones\n\n#### \\#1: Research project description (due Feb 6)\n\nThe ~2 page project description consists of a description of your proposed research project during the MATS program and a justification of why you chose this project in consultation with your mentor. The RP is intended to encourage fellows to critically evaluate their project’s theory of change and provide the MATS team and MATS grant manager with data on the program.\n\nMore information will be released about the project description in the coming weeks.\n\n#### \\#2: Fellow Symposium (March 28)\n\nThe Research Phase concludes with a full-day Symposium, during which all fellows present posters about their research project and some teams deliver 10-minute talks to their peers and members of the Berkeley AI safety community.\n\nYou can find more information about the assignment, along with the rubric and and submission form on the Symposium section of the Fellow Handbook.\n\n### Research Projects\n\nDuring the research phase of the program, mentors will meet with fellows for around 1-2 h/week to share their research agenda and supervise the fellows’ research projects. Fellows' research directions may initially be chosen by the mentors, but by default, fellows are expected to develop their independent research direction as the program continues.\n\n![👋 Callout icon](<Base64-Image-Removed>)\n\nMeta has restricted LLaMa usage to organizations with fewer than 700 million monthly active users, prohibiting use by the following organizations: Alphabet, Tencent, TikTok, Microsoft, Snap, and Telegram. Because Google DeepMind is owned by Alphabet, fellows working with DeepMind mentors are encouraged to check in with them about this. If you anticipate this will be disruptive to your work at MATS, please reach out to Ryan via Slack.\n\n![🖊️ Callout icon](<Base64-Image-Removed>)\n\nMATS does not handle IP discussions; mentors and fellows should discuss IP ownership in the first few weeks. Consult Christian for help at christian@matsprogram.org.\n\n### Posting on LessWrong\n\nWe are excited for you to share your research with the global alignment community! Regarding posting on LessWrong, we recommend:\n\nUse [shortform](https://www.lesswrong.com/shortform) for fast, unfiltered ideas you want to share;\n\nSeek feedback on drafts in the [#feedback-on-posts-or-drafts](https://serialignment-qo78019.slack.com/archives/C03NFC8D5PS) Slack channel if you want help improving technical aspects, clarity, or conciseness;\n\nAsk your mentor if they are interested in providing feedback on drafts.\n\nPlease add the [“MATS program” tag](https://www.lesswrong.com/tag/mats-program) and a disclaimer, “Produced as part of the [MATS Program](https://www.matsprogram.org/) \\- Winter 2026 Cohort” to all posts that were produced as part of the MATS program so that:\n\nThe MATS team can monitor fellow output;\n\nOur grant managers and ecosystem partners can assess MATS' output.\n\nThere is no need to add disclaimers for shortform posts.\n\n### Housing and Offices\n\nWe have acquired office space and housing for fellows in Berkeley, California from Jan 4 to March 29. We also offer the possibility to be remote or work from our London office, although this is not encouraged and may compromise the program's quality. Please contact Kali at kali@matsprogram.org if you have concerns regarding agreed-upon housing arrangements or if you have any questions. See the Housing section and the Office section in the Fellow Handbook for more information.\n\n### Seminar Program\n\nEducational seminars and workshops will be held 2-4 times per week. See the [Events Calendar](https://scholar-handbook.super.site/events-calendar) for details, and you can find recordings [here](https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fo/gbxkv6pm7fs30sduuc773/AC9CC81V0ZS_k2-Phl7yEz4?rlkey=mm3lck9esae3sxsaoffxh5wgy&st=xsvqz5b0&dl=0).\n\n## Extension Phase Overview\n\n### Purpose\n\nThe Extension Phase is aimed at supporting fellows to pursue their research projects with increasing autonomy from their mentors and the structure that MATS provided in the Research Phase. During the Extension, we expect that fellows formalize their research projects into what are usually their first publications, and begin to compare potential next steps and future directions. To support them in this, we continue to offer day-to-day productivity support (e.g., daily stand-ups, Research Management debugging, 1:1 career coaching), and we put on a mixture of seminars, workshops, and networking events, especially for the fellows based in the London office.\n\nThis is all with the aim of preparing fellows to transition out of the supportive environment of the MATS program, by frequently reminding them to further develop their longer term plans, and to make new connections that help them advance those plans. All the while, we expect that fellows receive continued support from their mentors, albeit in most cases with decreasing frequency.\n\n### Location\n\nBy default, the Extension takes place at the MATS office in London. You will have access to MATS support staff, an office space, and other resources. There is no guarantee that there will be sufficient office space available to you in Berkeley as the MATS office will close down once the program is complete.\n\n### Application Process\n\nIn the middle of the Research Phase, fellows will have the opportunity to meet with their mentor and request that they submit a recommendation for an Extension to the MATS team. This recommendation is essentially an endorsement by the mentor for you to continue your research project under their supervision for an additional 6-12 month period. The mentor reference and the fellow research project description will be the two primary factors in Extension Phase decisions.\n\nMATS will be able to offer funding to Extension Phase fellows, without them needing to apply for external funding. This funding would cover a stipend for the fellow, any needed compute resources, and any needed office space. If MATS does not have enough funds available to support a fellow during the extension phase, we encourage them to explore external funding options if the fellow and their mentor are interested in pursuing the extension–while not guaranteed, it is possible that MATS may be able to support fellows that secure external funding. Possible external funder include [Open Philanthropy](https://www.openphilanthropy.org/) or the [Long Term Future Fund](https://funds.effectivealtruism.org/funds/far-future) (LTFF). The year-round [Career Development and Transition Funding (CDTF)](https://www.openphilanthropy.org/career-development-and-transition-funding/) program supports individuals pursuing or transitioning into research aimed at reducing global catastrophic risks. [Manifund Regrants](https://manifund.org/), is a platform where AI Safety experts allocate funds quickly and flexibly. Additional options typically open applications only once or twice a year. These include [Cooperative AI Foundation (CAIF)](https://www.cooperativeai.com/), the [AI Safety Fund (AISF)](https://www.aisafetyfund.org/), the [CLR Fund](https://longtermrisk.org/grantmaking/) and the [AI Risk Mitigation Fund](https://www.airiskfund.com/). MATS is available to help fellows navigate these funding processes if they choose to apply to any of these. MATS is additionally happy to help alumni find a position at an established alignment research organization or acquire funding from other sources.\n\n## Berkeley Office\n\n![🐭 Callout icon](<Base64-Image-Removed>)\n\nPlease keep the doors to building A and B closed at night otherwise critters tend to come in because they smell snacks.\n\n## Location\n\nThe office is located at 2740 Telegraph Avenue. You should enter via the main gate on Telegraph. The code is 4517.\n\nOffice assignments have been distributed via Slack, in your stream channel. During the first week, Kali will be providing tours for groups fellows to help you locate supplies, meeting rooms, call rooms, etc.\n\nTour schedule will be announced in the first week.\n\n## Office Floor Plan, Labeled by Stream\n\n![💡 Callout icon](<Base64-Image-Removed>)\n\nThe Lightcone team and a small number of researchers will be working on the property.\n\n[Floorplan](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/11Gp_hMndhv065uT8VnQ55OWn7iX1t9y1T5CDTI_7C94/edit?slide=id.g245597ecf6b_0_0#slide=id.g245597ecf6b_0_0) here.\n\nIf you can’t find your stream office on the chart, check the Slack channel for your stream.\n\nThe second floor of building A is off limits to fellows unless you have a meeting with your Research Manager or another team member.\n\nBuilding F and the back side of D (facing away from the property) are off limits, they belong to the Lighthaven team.\n\n## WiFi\n\nNetwork: LightFi\n\nPassword: wearethelight\n\n## Office equipment\n\nStandard office equipment is provided to fellows at the start of the cohort when working from our offices. Lighthaven fellows can use the [office request form](https://airtable.com/appZq2f1sM0tW9kH7/pagQXSzPyPRWV8H0H/form) to submit requests for equipment and other inquiries to improve their working environments. At the end of the program, it is expected to be returned to MATS, including those obtained from the office request form.\n\n## Food\n\nWe provide lunch and dinner Mon-Fri. Lunch arrives by 1 pm and dinner arrives by 6 pm. Leftovers are placed in the fridge in building B a few hours after food arrives. Do not take food that has someone else’s name on it, not even from the leftovers fridge. Also, note that leftover food will be thrown away after 2 days.\n\nSnacks and coffee are available in the kitchen areas. Meal and snack-related requests should be submitted via the [request form](https://airtable.com/appZq2f1sM0tW9kH7/pagQXSzPyPRWV8H0H/form).\n\nIf you use a non-disposable dish, please throw out any food left on the plate and place it in the dishwasher. There are two dishwashers in building A, and one in building B.\n\n## Guests\n\n![‼️ Callout icon](<Base64-Image-Removed>)\n\nLighthaven's policies apply to the office space, as well as housing. See the Housing section for information on house guests.\n\nOffice guests contribute to a vibrant workplace! Examples of visits from guests include bringing a non-MATS person into the office, co-working or eating a meal in the office, giving a friend or family member a tour, etc. Guests are allowed to use common spaces and, if given permission by the stream, a research stream’s private space. If this policy is overused and the office space becomes too crowded, a stricter policy will be put in place. Research streams may develop stricter guest policies for their office space.\n\n![📋 Callout icon](<Base64-Image-Removed>)\n\nWe have two different forms: one for your [personal guests](https://airtable.com/appZq2f1sM0tW9kH7/pagRDl1p3SzDhh25S/form) (such as friends and family) and one for acquaintances or [people from the community](https://airtable.com/appZq2f1sM0tW9kH7/pagvVP821ZgDug1nI/form) who would like to visit or co-work out of the MATS office.\n\n### Personal guests\n\nYou are welcome to bring guests to the office at Lighthaven. By and large we trust you to make reasonable choices and exercise good judgment with the visitors you host. When hosting a visitor, you are responsible for your visitor’s behavior, and, like with all our policies, please aspire to follow the spirit of the policy, and not just the letter of the law. Please fill out [this form](https://airtable.com/appZq2f1sM0tW9kH7/pagRDl1p3SzDhh25S/form) yourself for your personal guests. Note that you are responsible for them abiding by the Community Health Policy.\n\n### AIS community guests or acquaintances\n\nFor guests that are not your personal guests, please direct them to the [Expression of Interest Form](https://airtable.com/appZq2f1sM0tW9kH7/pagvVP821ZgDug1nI/form) to receive approval from the MATS team. A guest must receive email approval to enter the Office. Until they receive approval, they are not invited to the office. A guest must fill out the form for each independent visit.\n\nThe form should be filled out again for each subsequent visit request not covered by previous entries of the EOI form (e.g., if they just wanted to visit for occasional meetings previously, but now want a hotdesk).\n\nGuests should indicate their hosting-fellow when filling out the EOI form.\n\nMinors require a signed parental consent form to visit the office (linked in EOI form above).\n\nGuests are expected to act professionally in the office. All rules in the Community Health Policy apply to guests. If a guest is unsure about whether they should share information that they learned in the office with people outside the MATS community, please contact a member of the MATS team, who will provide guidance.\n\nPlease submit the EOI form at least one full business day before the requested visit. If the request is time-sensitive (e.g., you bumped into Stuart Russell at the coffee shop, and you want to invite him to work at Lighthaven for the afternoon), you should message Jana on Slack.\n\nYou can see current and upcoming guests on the [Who’s Visiting Page](https://scholar-handbook.super.site/whos-visiting). If you are uncomfortable with someone on that list visiting the office, please reach out to the Community Manager immediately.\n\n## Packages\n\nPackages with your name on them will be brought to your office or bedroom if you are working or living at Lighthaven. Fellows who are neither working nor living at Lighthaven, if they have packages delivered there, should expect to find them in the front room of A (to the right of the main door as you walk in).\n\nAlways include a second address line on your packages with the gate code (4517), like this:\n\nFirstname Lastname\n\n2740 Telegraph Avenue\n\nGATE CODE: 4517\n\nBerkeley, CA\n\n94705\n\n## Call Rooms\n\nCall and meeting rooms are available in the basement of Building B. [Tactic](https://matsresearchinc.gettactic.com/) is our room booking system at Lighthaven, please join via [this link](https://matsresearchinc.gettactic.com/signup?join=VuDvLtUKW3Rx4Zq7) to access the platform. If you need a booth and none are available, message Kali on Slack.\n\nSeveral of the stream offices also include call booths.\n\n## Whiteboards\n\nIn addition to the whiteboards in the office rooms, there are large rolling whiteboards throughout the office. Feel free to take any unused whiteboard and use it! On whiteboards in common space, erase whatever you want unless it says DNE (do not erase), “save” or similar. If you're actively using a whiteboard but want to step out for a minute / continue in the morning, you can write DNE until <date>, though we recommend taking photos just in case.  Also, if you do erase a public board, please take a photo and upload it to the #whiteboards channel in Slack.\n\n## Nap Room\n\nThere are four pods for napping on the first floor of building E, labeled “Sleeping Pods” on the above floor plan. The pods are refreshed frequently. If using a pod, write your name on the door. Sometimes guests use the pods.\n\nThe door to this room is to remain closed at all times. The code is 9474.\n\n## Printing\n\nThere is a printer in the ground floor common area of Building A. Please contact Raj on Slack for any printer questions.\n\n## Temperature\n\nThere is no central heating or cooling. However, we have a large number of fans, ACs, radiators, portable heaters, etc available. If you would like any of these for your office (many offices will come equipped with one by default), please fill out the [request form](https://airtable.com/appZq2f1sM0tW9kH7/pagQXSzPyPRWV8H0H/form). We have blankets available throughout the office.\n\n## Bikes\n\nBikes can be stored anywhere, so long as they are not obstructing a walkway. It is recommended to lock your bike. If you prefer a specific and out of the way place, you can store your bike on the deck North of building A.\n\n## Slack Channels\n\nMATS Slack norms are:\n\nReply to a specific message in a thread, not to the whole channel. This is to keep conversations in one place and not overwhelm channels.\n\nEverything that applies to the MATS office space per the CHP applies to the MATS Slack as well, e.g. no harassment, romantic advances, etc.\n\nYour stream-\\[mentor name\\]-9 channel is meant to be the main communication channel for you, all other fellows working with your mentor, and your mentor. It is a great place to ask questions, as the MATS team can jump in as necessary.\n\nThe announcements-9 channel will be where the MATS team will post important reminders and tips. Turn notifications on for this channel.\n\nThe cohort-9 channel is a place for fellows, mentors, and MATS team members to post program and research project-relevant questions and announcements. We encourage you to e.g. start your own discussion groups and ask any clarifying questions that may unblock you and other fellows.\n\nThe social-events-9 channel is where we welcome anyone to organize their own events, and random-9 is for anything else.\n\nAll people in the MATS Slack are added to the channels #general and #introductions. But, there are more channels in the MATS slack that most fellows are part of.\n\nYou can join open channels by clicking on “Add channels” and then “browse channels.” Then, click “join” on the channels that you would like to be part of. Here are additional channels that are commonly used and descriptions of the content in those channels:\n\n#appreciation - To share gratefulness\n\n#climbing - To coordinate plans for climbing, e.g., after work.\n\n#opportunities - Opportunities for funding, jobs, fellowships, research collaborations, etc.\n\n#photos - To share pictures you take\n\n#random - To ask questions, share thoughts, and send messages when you aren’t sure what channel they belong in.\n\n#study - There are a couple of study group channels. These channels start with #study (eg: #study-mech-interp).\n\n#technical\\_questions - Need help debugging? Post here!\n\n#whiteboards - To upload photos of public whiteboards before you erase them.\n\n## Research Management\n\n## Overview\n\nAll fellows have access to research support professionals, who aim to enhance your program experience and maximize the value of the mentorship you receive. Each stream has an assigned Research Manager(RM), who conducts weekly check-ins with fellows and communicates pertinent information with the mentor.\n\n![🤫 Callout icon](<Base64-Image-Removed>)\n\nWe uphold confidentiality according to the MATS Air-Gapping Policy. You can always ask about confidentiality during your meetings. Our policy is [available here](https://matsprogram.notion.site/7bc427dbf2d742bfb461dfb67d7f22bc?pvs=25) (it’s the same as the previous cohort’s).\n\n## Assignments\n\nResearch manager assignments for the program are forthcoming. See their bios on the MATS [website](https://www.matsprogram.org/team).\n\n![⁉️ Callout icon](<Base64-Image-Removed>)\n\nReach out to Laura if you have concerns about your RM.\n\n## Research Managers\n\nAt the start of the program, you will schedule a standing weekly 30-minute meeting with your RM. During these meetings, you will discuss a series of check-in questions. With your permission, the RM will share detailed notes with your mentor, typically emphasizing the progress their fellows are making and the obstacles they are facing. Some mentors may also meet periodically with their RM to discuss fellow experiences.\n\n![](https://matsprogram.notion.site/image/https%3A%2F%2Fprod-files-secure.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2F0d3e27ad-4523-4665-9d59-8502d77dc404%2F5ff15351-df94-4051-b8e6-34bab99d93f5%2Funnamed-2.png?table=block&id=2dfa0e14-b0ad-80fa-a880-c6e946aaad8d&spaceId=0d3e27ad-4523-4665-9d59-8502d77dc404&width=770&userId=&cache=v2)\n\n![🙋‍♀️ Callout icon](<Base64-Image-Removed>)\n\nIf you would prefer to meet with another Research Manager instead of the Manager you were assigned, please reach out to Laura to request reassignment. We will be considering such requests on an individual basis in service of smooth coordination within streams.\n\nIf your mentor does not require you have regular meetings with your assigned Research Manager, you are strongly encouraged to meet with one regularly or on an as-needed basis anyway. As opposed to mentors who provide object-level research direction and support, RMs can help with meta-level activities such as seeking solutions to bottlenecks (both research and personal), making the most out of your time with your mentor(s), general debugging, executive support, prioritization, motivation, orientation, and other general support to help you get the most out of your time at MATS.\n\nHere are some concrete examples of how we can help you:\n\nOne-on-Ones\n\nWe can meet with you, one-on-one, either regularly or as a one-off, to discuss and debug anything that’s affecting your effectiveness in or enjoyment of the MATS program.\n\nCheck-ins\n\nWe can check-in with you via text, phone, virtually, or in-person about anything you’d like (some people like this as an accountability mechanism, or as a useful reminder system).\n\nInform you of MATS resources\n\nMATS offers more resources and opportunities than most fellows will have time to read or learn about. Sometimes a conversation with us can reveal that one of your problems is easily solvable by a pre-existing program resource that you didn’t know about.\n\nPrepare you for meetings with your mentor\n\nYou have finite time with your mentors, and it can be hard to know what the most useful questions to ask or most useful subjects to discuss are. Clarifying your thoughts with us first can help you get more value-per-minute with your mentor.\n\nClarifying your thoughts\n\nWe love helping people de-confuse themselves on almost any subject. Whether it’s your workflow, a technical quandary, or just your feelings that you’re confused about, we’re great at active listening, asking insightful questions, and offering new framings\n\nDiscussing sensitive / confidential subjects\n\nHaving a conflict with a stream-mate? Not getting what you want from your mentor, but not yet ready to talk to them about it? Frustrated with someone on MATS staff, but also not ready to talk to them either? Come vent to Research Management and we can help you find solutions while keeping everything confidential.\n\nTime management\n\nHelping you to create a schedule and plan your time effectively to make the most of your time at MATS.\n\nPrioritization\n\nAssisting you in determining which tasks are most important and helping you to focus on those tasks first.\n\nMotivation\n\nHelping you with motivational obstacles, like distraction, procrastination, fatigue, etc.\n\nExecutive support\n\nNeed help designing a productivity or organizational system for your workflow. We can help with that too.\n\nIdentifying and solving bottlenecks\n\nWhich step of your research process is most impeding your progress? We can help you identify it and explore solutions to speed it up.\n\nCollaborating well with others\n\nWe can help you figure out how to work effectively with your stream, including how to share ideas, delegate tasks, and resolve conflicts.\n\nPersonal support\n\nNot every conversation has to be about solving a problem. We can also just provide a supportive and understanding ear for you to discuss personal or emotional challenges you may be facing.\n\n## Community Health Policy\n\nPlease see the full Community Health Policy [here](https://matsprogram.notion.site/mats-community-health-policy).\n\nThe Community Team is here for fellow well-being, and consists of Jana Guraziu, Nate Simmons, and Vivian Ha as Community Managers, along with John Teichman as the Community Programs Officer, helping fellows and alumni with careers and job placement.\n\n## Compute & Research Resources\n\nSee here: [![💻](<Base64-Image-Removed>)Compute Docs](https://matsprogram.notion.site/Compute-Docs-2cfa0e14b0ad80c49c29f92e1a1bae42?pvs=24)\n\n## Housing\n\n## Residence Contact\n\nKali is coordinating housing and is the designated contact for fellows. If there’s an issue with your housing you can submit a ticket in [Request Form](https://airtable.com/appZq2f1sM0tW9kH7/pagQXSzPyPRWV8H0H/form). For more urgent needs, you can call Kali at +1 435-994-2638. If there is an actual emergency or safety issue, please call 911.\n\n## Guests\n\nGuests are welcome to [Lighthaven](https://www.lighthaven.space/) for visits that take place after official working hours (after 7 PM on weekdays and on weekends), as long as they are accompanied by a fellow during their visit. House guests visiting housing do not need to fill out the EOI form, but they must respect the rules of the house (e.g., no parties), and housemate agreements (e.g., quiet hours). It is the host fellow's responsibility to ensure their guests respect the [Community Health Policy](https://matsprogram.notion.site/mats-community-health-policy).\n\nSee the Office section for information on office guests.\n\n## Lighthaven Policies\n\nNo smoking of any kind.\n\nNo psychoactive drugs other than prescriptions, alcohol, or edible marijuana (and only the latter two if you're older than 21 per California law).\n\nNo minors (people under 18) overnight without a guardian present.\n\nNo letting in of people you don’t know.\n\nIf someone is neither a fellow nor your guest, please ask them to wait at the gate, press the doorbell, and a member of staff will come to meet them. (In particular: don’t let anyone in who is a neighbor,\n\n... [917 lines truncated] ...","is_error":false}]},"isSidechain":false}
