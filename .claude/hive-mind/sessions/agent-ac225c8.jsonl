Let me provide you with the details:\n\n## Available Vercel Skills\n\nYou have three Vercel skills configured in your Claude Code environment:\n\n1. **/vercel:setup** - Set up Vercel CLI and configure the project\n2. **/vercel:logs** - View deployment logs from Vercel\n3. **/vercel:deploy** - Deploy the current project to Vercel\n\nThese skills are part of the `vercel@claude-plugins-official` plugin, which is enabled in your settings.\n\n## How to Use Them\n\nSimply invoke them as slash commands within Claude Code:\n\n- `/vercel:setup` - Run this first to initialize Vercel CLI and configure your project for deployments\n- `/vercel:logs` - Use this to view recent deployment logs from your Vercel project\n- `/vercel:deploy` - Use this to deploy your current project to Vercel\n\n## Current Configuration\n\nThe Vercel plugin is enabled in your `settings.json`:\n```json\n\"vercel@claude-plugins-official\": true\n```\n\nThese skills integrate with the Vercel CLI and provide streamlined access to common Vercel operations without needing to manually run CLI commands. They're particularly useful for your frontend projects when you need to deploy or troubleshoot deployments.\n\nIs there a specific Vercel task you'd like help with? I can guide you through using one of these skills."}],"model":"claude-haiku-4-5-20251001","stop_reason":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":3,"cache_creation_input_tokens":8669,"cache_read_input_tokens":0,"cache_creation":{"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":8669,"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":0},"output_tokens":331,"service_tier":"standard"},"type":"message","stop_sequence":null},"isSidechain":true,"cwd":"/Users/yoav/worktrees/alignment-hive/onboarding-flow","version":"2.1.6","gitBranch":"onboarding-flow","agentId":"ac225c8"}
