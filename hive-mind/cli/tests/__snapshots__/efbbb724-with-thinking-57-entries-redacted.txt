Can get more technical towards the bottom, but we can also add nested README files for more technical information on particular plugins (such as hive-mind)", "Should the README mention hive-mind at all, or keep it abstract until it's more mature?"="Mention briefly", "What should happen to the 'Current Plan' and 'Immediate Next Steps' sections?"="Move to docs/plan.md".

What problem does this solve?"="I like the infrastructure framing, but I'd like to lean a bit more into both the concept of accelerating safety research, and of sharing knowledge (not just tools). hive-mind is one way to share knowledge, but I also expect researchers to sometimes explicitly contribute knowledge through agent skills and plugins. Another approach point: I expect large orgs to benefit from shared tooling and knowledge in a way that individual researchers won't, so I want to give level the playing field by giving alignment researchers some of the same benefits", "Should the README include a 'Roadmap' or 'Coming Soon' section?"="Now that you mention it, I think the file should be named "roadmap" rather than "plan", and we could link to it.
