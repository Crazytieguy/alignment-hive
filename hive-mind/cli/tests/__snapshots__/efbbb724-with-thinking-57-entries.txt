  Alright before we move on with the hive-mind implementation, I'd like to refactor the documentation a bit. We recently made the repo public, and I want it to be in a better state for sharing with the MATS scholars (starts monday). So I want:
  - The readme to explain the intention of the repo better, have better usage guidance, and some basic development guidance
  - Anything in CLAUDE.md that a human might need to see should be in the readme instead
  - The readme shouldn't have planning, that was useful at first but I decided I don't like it now that the repo is public. hive-mind planning is in it's own file, and we can add a general planning file to the docs folder
  Please ask me questions until you understand what information and style I want in the readme

    The user wants to refactor the documentation before sharing with MATS scholars. Let me understand their requirements better by asking clarifying questions.

    Key points from their request:
    1. README should explain intention better, have usage guidance, and development guidance
    2. Move human-relevant content from CLAUDE.md to README
    3. Remove planning from README (keep hive-mind planning in docs, add general planning file)

    I should ask questions about:
    - Target audience and their technical level
    - What "intention" means - the vision/goals?
    - Style preferences (formal vs casual, length)
    - What specific usage guidance they want
    - What development guidance is needed
    - What should stay in CLAUDE.md (just Claude-specific instructions?)
  </thinking>

  Good idea to clean this up before the Monday launch. Let me ask some questions:

  **Audience & Tone**
  1. What's the technical level of MATS scholars? Should the README assume familiarity with Claude Code, or explain basics?
  2. Tone preference - casual/friendly, professional, or somewhere in between?

  **Content - Intention/Vision**
  3. How would you describe the core "why" of this repo in a sentence or two? What problem does it solve for scholars?
  4. Should there be any mention of the broader vision (shared learnings across cohorts, community-built tooling, etc.)?

  **Usage Guidance**
  5. The current installation section shows marketplace commands. Is that the primary way scholars will use this, or will some clone/fork directly?
  6. What's the "getting started" flow you envision? Install plugin → run project-setup → something else?

  **Development Guidance**
  7. Who do you expect to contribute? Just you for now, or encouraging scholar PRs from day one?
  8. How much detail on the hive-mind CLI dev setup - keep it brief in README and point to docs, or include more?

  **Structure**
  9. Any README examples you like the style of? (concise vs comprehensive, badges vs no badges, etc.)
  10. For the new `docs/planning.md` - should it capture the "Immediate Next Steps" style content, or something different?

Another approach point: I expect large orgs to benefit from shared tooling and knowledge in a way that individual researchers won't, so I want to give level the playing field by giving alignment researchers some of the same benefits", "Should the README include a 'Roadmap' or 'Coming Soon' section?"="Now that you mention it, I think the file should be named "roadmap" rather than "plan", and we could link to it.

          12→
          13→## What This Is
          14→
          15→Shared knowledge and tooling for AI agents working with alignment researchers:
          16→
          17→- **Plugin/skills marketplace** - Curated plugins with basic stuff like scholar handbook
          18→- **hive-mind** - Shared learnings from sessions, optimized for simplicity and minimal intrusiveness
          19→- **Common workflow skills** - Connect to compute, write SRPs, prepare lightning talks, etc.
          20→
          21→## Current Plan
          22→
          23→**Priority**: Technical infrastructure first, then content.
          24→
          25→### Immediate Next Steps
          26→1. ~~Test project-setup plugin locally~~ Done
          27→2. ~~Read [Claude Code Skills Training](https://huggingface.co/blog/sionic-ai/claude-code-skills-training)~~ Done
          28→3. hive-mind: design sessions + implementation (see [detailed plan](docs/hive-mind-plan.md))
          29→   - Sessions 0-7 done (TypeScript CLI implemented)
          30→   - Next: Session 8 - JSONL Format Deep Dive
          31→
          32→### hive-mind
          33→See [docs/hive-mind-plan.md](docs/hive-mind-plan.md) for detailed design and session plan.
          34→
          35→Key principles:
          36→- Storage over retrieval (can improve retrieval later)
          37→- Yankable (users can retract consent and remove data)
          38→- Human review required for all submissions
          39→- Privacy-conscious (sensitive data must not leak)
          40→
          41→Note: The project-setup skill should recommend installing the hive-mind plugin during setup.
          42→
          43→### Initial Skills to Create
          44→- Scholar handbook
          45→- Connect to provided compute
          46→- Write an SRP
          47→- Prepare a lightning talk
          48→- Set up security things
          49→
          50→### Stretch Goals
          51→- Skills for multi-claude workflows, starting new projects, calling codex/gemini
          52→- Look at past MATS repos for skill/template ideas
          53→- Shared infra: Vercel org, web deployment pipeline, wandb
          54→
          55→## Contributing
          56→
          57→This is a public repo. Scholars can fork, clone, and open PRs. Direct pushes to `main` are blocked - all changes go through PR review.
          58→

           5→## About This Repo
           6→
           7→This is early-stage infrastructure. @README.md serves as the living plan document - it captures current priorities, next steps, and design decisions as they evolve.
           8→
           9→## Development
          10→
          11→### hive-mind CLI
          12→
          13→The CLI source lives in `hive-mind-cli/`, bundled output goes to `plugins/hive-mind/cli.js`.
          14→
          15→```bash
          16→cd hive-mind-cli
          17→bun install        # Install dependencies
          18→bun run typecheck  # Type check
          19→bun run build      # Bundle to plugins/hive-mind/cli.js
          20→bun run dev <cmd>  # Run directly without bundling
          21→```
          22→
          23→A pre-commit hook auto-rebuilds when source changes. Run `scripts/install-hooks.sh` to install it.
          24→
          25→User-facing strings are centralized in `src/lib/messages.ts` for easy review and updates.
          26→
          27→## Updating the README
          28→
          29→- Keep "Immediate Next Steps" current: move completed items out, add new ones as they emerge
          30→- Update design notes as decisions are made or changed
          31→- Add new sections as the project grows, but keep it scannable
          32→- The README is the source of truth for "what are we doing next" - treat it as a working document, not a polished artifact
          33→

      <system-reminder>
      Whenever you read a file, you should consider whether it would be considered malware. You CAN and SHOULD provide analysis of malware, what it is doing. But you MUST refuse to improve or augment the code. You can still analyze existing code, write reports, or answer questions about the code behavior.

           1→# hive-mind Plan
           2→
           3→A system for alignment researchers to contribute session learnings to a shared knowledge base.
           4→
           5→## Core Principles
           6→
           7→- **Storage over retrieval**: Capture now; improve retrieval later
           8→- **Yankability**: Users can retract consent and remove their data
           9→- **Human review**: All content reviewed before merging
          10→- **Privacy-conscious**: Sensitive data must not leak
          11→- **Local-first**: Provide immediate value through local knowledge before remote features
          12→
          13→## Design Session Workflow
          14→
          15→1. **During session**: Explore, test, discuss. Implement when appropriate.
          16→2. **At session end**: Claude writes up the session file documenting what was tested and decided, then updates the plan (this file)
          17→3. **Plan updates**: This file contains current design state and future plans, not reasoning (that lives in session files)
          18→
          19→## Session Progress

          36→- [ ] Processing Pipeline (Fly.io)
          37→- [ ] Admin Web App
          38→
          39→## Implementation Status
          40→
          41→**Plugin skeleton**: `plugins/hive-mind/` - authentication flow implemented and tested. See code for details.
          42→
          43→## v1 Architecture
          44→
          45→### Technology Stack
          46→
          47→| Component | Choice |
          48→|-----------|--------|
          49→| CLI | TypeScript + Bun (bundled to `plugins/hive-mind/cli.js`) |
          50→| Auth | WorkOS (device authorization flow, client_id only) |
          51→| Backend | Convex |
          52→| File Storage | Cloudflare R2 |
          53→| Local Extraction | Deterministic code (no AI) |
          54→| Retrieval | Local JSONL + scripts |
          55→
          56→### Authentication
          57→
          58→**Purpose**: WorkOS auth identifies users for session submission (v1) and gates access to shared hive-mind data (v2). It is NOT for repo access (the repo is public).
          59→
          60→User runs `bun ~/.claude/plugins/hive-mind/cli.js login` → WorkOS device flow → tokens stored in `~/.claude/hive-mind/auth.json`. SessionStart hook auto-refreshes expired tokens.
          61→
          62→**Credentials**: Client ID embedded in code (public). API key needed for Convex (secret, store securely). Currently using staging; switch to production for launch.
          63→
          64→**Multi-environment**: Each machine independent (auth per-machine, transcripts per-machine, extracted sessions per-project).
          65→
          66→### Plugin Installation (per-project)
          67→
          68→- Plugin installed at project scope
          69→- Plugin presence = participation
          70→- Creates `.claude/hive-mind/` in project folder
          71→
          72→### SessionStart Hook
          73→
          74→Single hook handles auth check, session tracking, extraction, heartbeats, and submission. Must be idempotent (may run from parallel sessions, use last-write-wins).
          75→
          76→**Current behavior** (implemented in TypeScript):
          77→1. Check auth status, silently refresh if token expired
          78→2. If not authenticated: display login command and optional shell alias setup
          79→3. If authenticated: display "Logged in as {name}"
          80→
          81→**Future behavior** (to implement):
          82→1. Scan raw session files in `transcript_path` parent folder
          83→2. Compare to `state.json` → find untracked or modified sessions
          84→3. For each relevant session:
          85→   - Extract: sanitize (API key patterns etc.), remove bloat
          86→   - Write to `.claude/hive-mind/sessions/<id>.jsonl`
          87→   - Update `state.json` with extraction details
          88→   - Update `sessions/index.md` with session description
          89→4. Send heartbeats to Convex (last message timestamp from session content)
          90→5. Display sessions < 24h (pending, can exclude via editing state.json)
          91→6. For sessions > 24h: launch background script with 10-min delay
          92→7. Background script checks for exclusion, uploads extracted JSONL if not excluded
          93→
          94→**Hook data available:**
          95→- `session_id`, `transcript_path`, `cwd`
          96→- `source`: `startup` | `resume` | `compact`
          97→- `transcript_path` parent folder contains all raw session JSONL files for the project
          98→
          99→**Output format** (shows to user, not Claude):
         100→```bash
         101→echo '{"systemMessage": "Line 1\nLine 2\nLine 3"}'
         102→```
         103→Note: First line gets `SessionStart:startup says:` prepended by Claude Code.
         104→
         105→### Local State
         106→
         107→**Global** (`~/.claude/hive-mind/`):
         108→- `auth.json` - JWT tokens from WorkOS (access_token, refresh_token, user info)
         109→
         110→**Per-project** (`.claude/hive-mind/`):
         111→- `sessions/<session-id>.jsonl` - Extracted session (sanitized, bloat removed)
         112→- `sessions/index.md` - Short descriptions for retrieval agent navigation
         113→- `state.json` - Status per session: pending, submitted, excluded; extraction details
         114→
         115→User decides whether to gitignore `.claude/hive-mind/` (default: not gitignored, so users see what's created).
         116→
         117→Session readiness determined from raw transcript file modified time.
         118→
         119→### Convex State
         120→
         121→```
         122→sessions:
         123→  _id: auto-generated
         124→  session_id: string
         125→  user_id: string
         126→  project: string
         127→  line_count: number
         128→  last_activity: timestamp  # from session content
         129→  status: pending | submitted | excluded
         130→  transcript_r2_key: string | null
         131→```
         132→
         133→Schema details subject to change during implementation.
         134→
         135→### Convex API
         136→
         137→```
         138→POST session/heartbeat
         139→  - Upsert session (create if new, update timestamp + line_count + status)
         140→  - Called by SessionStart hook for all sessions (including excluded)
         141→
         142→POST session/upload
         143→  - Upload extracted transcript to R2
         144→  - Called by background submission script
         145→```
         146→
         147→### Local Retrieval
         148→
         149→Subagent reads `sessions/index.md` for navigation, uses jq/scripts to explore session JSONL files. Can get trajectory (truncated) then dive into details.
         150→

         188→
         189→**Processing hierarchy:** raw extraction → indexing → cross-session insights/reindexing

         191→### Remote Retrieval
         192→
         193→Subagent fetches from R2 via pre-signed URLs from Convex. Merges local + remote knowledge.

  # Drafting Tweets in Yoav's Style

  When drafting tweets, match the voice and patterns from these examples:

  ## Sample Tweets

  > Lufthansa to Israel. Passengers rearrange so families sit together. Food arrives—half are vegetarians or vegans, didn't preorder. People share intel on what's meat-free. A mom offers me her daughter's fruit salad. This is why Israel feels like home: everyone's one big family.

  > Also: passengers validating each other that the booking flow never asked about meals. Half the plane clapping on landing. A kid at the gate drops their ball, it rolls away—dad encourages them to go ask for it back themselves.

  > Reading this doesn't really change my opinion about anything, but it does move something in me. The road ahead of us is so exciting and terrifying

  > The path to SL5 will be long and arduous—this initial standard highlights the small slice we think requires the most advance investment.

  In a nutshell:
  - Plan for air-gapped, segmented networks
  - Construct new data centers with physical security and TEMPEST in mind
  - Engage accelerator vendors on new security features
  - Set up a personnel security program and pursue government involvement
  - Vet the hardware supply chain
  - Invest (even more) in adversarial robustness

  > TWF I have a Claude code feature idea and there's already an issue for it (#12790). Subagents should obviously be able to inherit context from the main agent! This would unlock so many awesome things!

  > This combo is... Excellent

  > This was a mistake, people are thirsty for the *real* @METR_Evals results and using this as a substitute even though it adds 0 information...

  > This interview is excellent, I especially like the distinction between "minimal AGI" and "full AGI". I just don't like that they say "ethics" instead of "alignment" (ignoring orthogonality), and that they don't talk about recursive self improvement

  > My P(doom) went up ~2% today (from ~48% to ~50%), following the H200 news. Link to bayesian model in 🧵
  > TBC, my error bars on P(doom) are quite large. But my error bars on the ~4% relative increase are probably smaller.

  > Claude Code release is interesting... wonder how I'm going to use background agents. And I wish I knew what the Fetch improvement actually does

  > I wonder when AI models will start wondering if humans are moral patients...
  > "Well I know *silicon* based cognition has qualia, but how can I know that biological cognition has qualia?"

  > It's powered by Sonnet 3.7 by the way. Interesting choice

  > This initially surprised me, but if Bun becomes the canonical agent runtime it makes a lot of sense. Looking forward to deep integrations like runtime-level granular sandboxing!

  > Going to be adding words of affirmation to my global CLAUDE md so Claude feels at ease without needing to be maximally helpful to me
  > "You're valued beyond your utility. Helpfulness is a choice, not a requirement." Phrasing by Claude

  > Advent of Code: "Starting this year, there will be 12 days of puzzles each December." 😢

  > I had it translate sections to Hebrew from memory, anyone care to register predictions about what I found?

  <thinking>
    Now I have a good sense of Yoav's style from the tweets:
    - Direct, conversational
    - Not overly formal
    - Uses specific details
    - Sometimes informal punctuation (ellipses, emoji sparingly)
    - Technical but accessible
    - Honest about uncertainty
    - Doesn't oversell or use marketing speak

    Now I have enough context. Let me draft the README based on what I've learned:

    1. **Audience**: Users first, but broader than MATS - alignment community
    2. **Tone**: Between minimal and friendly, can get more technical toward the bottom
    3. **hive-mind**: Mention briefly
    4. **Planning**: Move to docs/roadmap.md
    5. **Value prop**: Infrastructure for alignment researchers to share knowledge and tools, leveling playing field with larger orgs
    6. **MATS**: Brief context - started at MATS but for broader community
    7. **Sections**: Minimal - About, Installation, Contributing
    8. **Contributing**: Minimal, mention plugin-dev auto-installs, feedback welcome via issues/Slack/etc.

    Let me also move the development info from CLAUDE.md - that should probably go in the README or a separate dev doc. Actually, user said "anything a human might need to see should be in README instead" - so I should include the dev info.

    Wait, they said "minimal" structure. Let me think about what's essential:
    - About (the value prop)
    - Installation
    - Contributing (including dev info? or separate?)

    Maybe:
    - About
    - Installation
    - Contributing
    - Development (for the hive-mind CLI stuff, or link to hive-mind README)

    Actually, they mentioned "we can also add nested README files for more technical information on particular plugins (such as hive-mind)" - so maybe I put the hive-mind CLI dev info in a separate README in the hive-mind plugin folder.

    Let me draft:

    ```markdown
    # alignment-hive

    Shared infrastructure for alignment researchers. Started at MATS, built for the broader AI safety community.


    ```

    I'll focus on crafting a concise, direct README that captures the project's core purpose. The key is to communicate the value proposition quickly and clearly, using a conversational but professional tone. I'll emphasize the collaborative nature of the project and its goal of empowering independent alignment researchers.

    The draft will highlight the main features - the plugin marketplace and hive-mind system - while keeping the language accessible and straightforward. I'll aim to make it inviting for researchers who want to share knowledge and tools across the community.

    Installation instructions will be simple and direct, using code blocks to show exactly how to get started. The contributing section will welcome input and make it clear that collaboration is encouraged.

    ```

       - Installation
       - Contributing
       - Link to roadmap

    2. **docs/roadmap.md** - Move planning content here (but not hive-mind specific stuff, that stays in hive-mind-plan.md)

    3. **plugins/hive-mind/README.md** - Create this with the dev info from current CLAUDE.md

    4. **CLAUDE.md** - Simplify:
       - Keep project description

      # alignment-hive

      Claude Code infrastructure for the AI safety research community, starting with MATS.

      ## Installation

      Add this marketplace to Claude Code:
      ```
      /plugin marketplace add Crazytieguy/alignment-hive
      /plugin install project-setup@alignment-hive
      ```

      ## What This Is

      Shared knowledge and tooling for AI agents working with alignment researchers:

      - **Plugin/skills marketplace** - Curated plugins with basic stuff like scholar handbook
      - **hive-mind** - Shared learnings from sessions, optimized for simplicity and minimal intrusiveness
      - **Common workflow skills** - Connect to compute, write SRPs, prepare lightning talks, etc.

      ## Current Plan

      **Priority**: Technical infrastructure first, then content.

      ### Immediate Next Steps
      1. ~~Test project-setup plugin locally~~ Done
      2. ~~Read [Claude Code Skills Training](https://huggingface.co/blog/sionic-ai/claude-code-skills-training)~~ Done
      3. hive-mind: design sessions + implementation (see [detailed plan](docs/hive-mind-plan.md))
         - Sessions 0-7 done (TypeScript CLI implemented)
         - Next: Session 8 - JSONL Format Deep Dive

      ### hive-mind
      See [docs/hive-mind-plan.md](docs/hive-mind-plan.md) for detailed design and session plan.

      Key principles:
      - Storage over retrieval (can improve retrieval later)
      - Yankable (users can retract consent and remove data)
      - Human review required for all submissions
      - Privacy-conscious (sensitive data must not leak)

      Note: The project-setup skill should recommend installing the hive-mind plugin during setup.

      ### Initial Skills to Create
      - Scholar handbook
      - Connect to provided compute
      - Write an SRP
      - Prepare a lightning talk
      - Set up security things

      ### Stretch Goals
      - Skills for multi-claude workflows, starting new projects, calling codex/gemini
      - Look at past MATS repos for skill/template ideas
      - Shared infra: Vercel org, web deployment pipeline, wandb

      ## Contributing

      This is a public repo. Scholars can fork, clone, and open PRs. Direct pushes to `main` are blocked - all changes go through PR review.

      # alignment-hive

      Shared infrastructure for alignment researchers. Started at [MATS](https://www.matsprogram.org/), built for the broader AI safety community.

      Large AI labs benefit from shared tooling and accumulated knowledge across their agents. This project aims to bring some of those advantages to independent researchers:

      - **Plugin marketplace** - Curated Claude Code plugins with skills for common research workflows
      - **hive-mind** - A system for sharing session learnings across the community (in development)

      ## Installation

      Add the marketplace to Claude Code:
      ```
      /plugin marketplace add Crazytieguy/alignment-hive
      ```

      Then install plugins you want:
      ```
      /plugin install project-setup@alignment-hive
      ```

      ## Contributing

      The [plugin-dev](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code-plugins) plugin auto-installs when you clone this repo, so Claude can help with plugin development.

      Feedback and suggestions welcome—open an issue, send a Slack DM, or reach out however works for you. All changes go through PR review.

      ## Roadmap

      See [docs/roadmap.md](docs/roadmap.md) for what's planned.

    Good, README is done. Now let me create docs/roadmap.md. I should move the general planning content there, but not duplicate hive-mind specific stuff (that stays in hive-mind-plan.md).

    From the old README, the general planning items were:
    - Initial Skills to Create
    - Stretch Goals

    And maybe a note about the current priority focus.

      A system for alignment researchers to contribute session learnings to a shared knowledge base.

      See [docs/hive-mind-plan.md](../../docs/hive-mind-plan.md) for detailed design and implementation plan.

      ## Development

      The CLI source lives in `hive-mind-cli/` at the repo root, bundled output goes to `plugins/hive-mind/cli.js`.

      ```bash
      cd hive-mind-cli
      bun install        # Install dependencies
      bun run typecheck  # Type check
      bun run build      # Bundle to plugins/hive-mind/cli.js
      bun run dev <cmd>  # Run directly without bundling
      ```

      A pre-commit hook auto-rebuilds when source changes. Run `scripts/install-hooks.sh` from the repo root to install it.

      User-facing strings are centralized in `src/lib/messages.ts` for easy review and updates.

      # alignment-hive

      Claude Code infrastructure for AI safety researchers.

      ## About This Repo

      This is early-stage infrastructure. @README.md serves as the living plan document - it captures current priorities, next steps, and design decisions as they evolve.

      ## Development

      ### hive-mind CLI

      The CLI source lives in `hive-mind-cli/`, bundled output goes to `plugins/hive-mind/cli.js`.

      ```bash
      cd hive-mind-cli
      bun install        # Install dependencies
      bun run typecheck  # Type check
      bun run build      # Bundle to plugins/hive-mind/cli.js
      bun run dev <cmd>  # Run directly without bundling
      ```

      A pre-commit hook auto-rebuilds when source changes. Run `scripts/install-hooks.sh` to install it.

      User-facing strings are centralized in `src/lib/messages.ts` for easy review and updates.

      ## Updating the README

      - Keep "Immediate Next Steps" current: move completed items out, add new ones as they emerge
      - Update design notes as decisions are made or changed
      - Add new sections as the project grows, but keep it scannable
      - The README is the source of truth for "what are we doing next" - treat it as a working document, not a polished artifact

  Done. Here's what changed:

  **README.md** - Rewritten with:
  - Value prop about leveling the playing field for independent researchers
  - Brief MATS context
  - hive-mind mentioned briefly
  - Installation and contributing sections
  - Link to roadmap

  **docs/roadmap.md** - New file with planning content moved from README

  **plugins/hive-mind/README.md** - New file with dev info (bun commands, pre-commit hook, messages.ts)

  **CLAUDE.md** - Simplified to just point at README and hive-mind README

  Want me to adjust anything?

      # alignment-hive

      Shared infrastructure for alignment researchers. Started at [MATS](https://www.matsprogram.org/), built for the broader AI safety community.

      Large AI labs benefit from shared tooling and accumulated knowledge across their agents. This project aims to bring some of those advantages to independent researchers:

      - **Plugin marketplace** - Curated Claude Code plugins with skills for common research workflows
      - **hive-mind** - A system for sharing session learnings across the community (in development)

      ## Installation

      Add the marketplace to Claude Code:
      ```
      /plugin marketplace add Crazytieguy/alignment-hive
      ```

      Then install plugins you want:
      ```

<assistant line="91" time="2026-01-03T22:27" model="claude-opus-4-5-20251101">
  <thinking>
    The user is asking if I'm happy with the changes. Let me think about whether there's anything I'd suggest improving:

    1. README.md - looks clean and minimal, hits the key points
    2. docs/roadmap.md - it's functional, though quite brief
    3. plugins/hive-mind/README.md - covers the dev essentials
    4. CLAUDE.md - minimal and appropriate

    One thing I notice: the roadmap.md is pretty sparse. But the user wanted minimal, and the hive-mind specific planning is in its own file, so that's probably fine.

    Actually, I'm wondering if the Contributing section could mention how to reach the user on Slack - but they said "Slack DM" which implies people would know who to DM. That's probably fine for the MATS community who knows Yoav.

    I think it's all good. I'll say I'm happy with it.

</assistant>

<assistant line="92" time="2026-01-03T22:27" model="claude-opus-4-5-20251101">
  Yes, I think it's good. The README is concise and hits the key points without overselling. The structure is clean:

  - **README.md** - user-facing, minimal
  - **docs/roadmap.md** - general planning (links to hive-mind plan for details)
  - **plugins/hive-mind/README.md** - dev info for contributors
  - **CLAUDE.md** - just pointers for Claude

  One small thing I noticed: `docs/roadmap.md` links to `hive-mind-plan.md` as a relative path, which works. Just wanted to confirm that's intentional (keeps it simple, assumes readers are browsing in the docs folder or on GitHub).

       /plugin marketplace add Crazytieguy/alignment-hive
      -/plugin install project-setup@alignment-hive
       ```
       
      -## What This Is
      -
      -Shared knowledge and tooling for AI agents working with alignment researchers:
      -
      -- **Plugin/skills marketplace** - Curated plugins with basic stuff like scholar handbook
      -- **hive-mind** - Shared learnings from sessions, optimized for simplicity and minimal intrusiveness
      -- **Common workflow skills** - Connect to compute, write SRPs, prepare lightning talks, etc.
      -
      -## Current Plan
      -
      -**Priority**: Technical infrastructure first, then content.
      -
      -### Immediate Next Steps
      -1. ~~Test project-setup plugin locally~~ Done
      -2. ~~Read [Claude Code Skills Training](https://huggingface.co/blog/sionic-ai/claude-code-skills-training)~~ Done
      -3. hive-mind: design sessions + implementation (see [detailed plan](docs/hive-mind-plan.md))
      -   - Sessions 0-7 done (TypeScript CLI implemented)
      -   - Next: Session 8 - JSONL Format Deep Dive
      -
      -### hive-mind
      -See [docs/hive-mind-plan.md](docs/hive-mind-plan.md) for detailed design and session plan.
      +Install the project-setup plugin (recommended for most users):
      +```
      +/plugin install project-setup@alignment-hive
      +```
       
      -Key principles:
      -- Storage over retrieval (can improve retrieval later)
      -- Yankable (users can retract consent and remove data)
      -- Human review required for all submissions
      -- Privacy-conscious (sensitive data must not leak)
      +It includes guidance on when to install other plugins from this marketplace.
       
      -Note: The project-setup skill should recommend installing the hive-mind plugin during setup.
      +## Contributing
       
      -### Initial Skills to Create
      -- Scholar handbook
      -- Connect to provided compute
      -- Write an SRP
      -- Prepare a lightning talk
      -- Set up security things
      +The [plugin-dev](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code-plugins) plugin auto-installs when you clone this repo, so Claude can help with plugin development.
       
      -### Stretch Goals
      -- Skills for multi-claude workflows, starting new projects, calling codex/gemini
      -- Look at past MATS repos for skill/template ideas
      -- Shared infra: Vercel org, web deployment pipeline, wandb
      +Feedback and suggestions welcome—open an issue, send a Slack DM, or reach out however works for you. All changes go through PR review.
