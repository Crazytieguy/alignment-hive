  Alright before we move on with the hive-mind implementation, I'd like to refactor the documentation a bit. We recently made the repo public, and I want it to be in a better state for sharing with the MATS scholars (starts monday). So I want:
  - The readme to explain the intention of the repo better, have better usage guidance, and some basic development guidance
  - Anything in CLAUDE.md that a human might need to see should be in the readme instead
  - The readme shouldn't have planning, that was useful at first but I decided I don't like it now that the repo is public. hive-mind planning is in it's own file, and we can add...24words

  The user wants to refactor the documentation before sharing with MATS scholars. Let me understand their requirements better by asking clarifying questions.

  Key points from their request:
  1. README should explain intention better, have usage guidance, and development guidance
  2. Move human-relevant content from CLAUDE.md to README
  3. Remove planning from README (keep hive-mind planning in docs, add general planning file)

  I should ask questions about:
  - Target audience and their technical level
  - What "intention" means - the vision/goals?
  - Style preferences (formal vs casual, length)
  - What specific usage guidance they want
  - What development guidance is needed
  - What should stay in CLAUDE.md (just Claude-specific instructions?)
6|21:56|assistant
  Good idea to clean this up before the Monday launch. Let me ask some questions:

  **Audience & Tone**
  1. What's the technical level of MATS scholars? Should the README assume familiarity with Claude Code, or explain basics?
  2. Tone preference - casual/friendly, professional, or somewhere in between?

  **Content - Intention/Vision**
  3. How would you describe the core "why" of this repo in a sentence or two? What problem does it solve for scholars?
  4. Should there be any mention of the broader vision (shared learnings across cohorts, community-built tooling, etc.)?

  **Usage Guidance**
  5. The current installation section shows marketplace commands. Is that the primary way scholars will use this, or will some clone/fork directly?
  6. What's...93words

  # Drafting Tweets in Yoav's Style

  When drafting tweets, match the voice and patterns from these examples:

  ## Sample Tweets

  > Lufthansa to Israel. Passengers rearrange so families sit together. Food arrives—half are vegetarians or vegans, didn't preorder. People share intel on what's meat-free. A mom offers me her daughter's fruit salad. This is why Israel feels like home: everyone's one big family.

  > Also: passengers validating each other that the booking flow never asked about meals. Half the plane clapping on landing. A kid at the gate drops their ball, it rolls away—dad encourages them to go ask for it back themselves.

  > Reading this doesn't really change my...610words
30|22:15|thinking
  Now I have a good sense of Yoav's style from the tweets:
  - Direct, conversational
  - Not overly formal
  - Uses specific details
  - Sometimes informal punctuation (ellipses, emoji sparingly)
  - Technical but accessible
  - Honest about uncertainty
  - Doesn't oversell or use marketing speak

  Now I have enough context. Let me draft the README based on what I've learned:

  1. **Audience**: Users first, but broader than MATS - alignment community
  2. **Tone**: Between minimal and friendly, can get more technical toward the bottom
  3. **hive-mind**: Mention briefly
  4. **Planning**: Move to docs/roadmap.md
  5. **Value prop**: Infrastructure for alignment researchers to share knowledge and tools, leveling playing field with larger orgs
  6. **MATS**: Brief context - started at MATS but for broader community
  7. **Sections**: Minimal - About, Installation, Contributing
  8. **Contributing**: Minimal, mention plugin-dev auto-installs, feedback welcome via issues/Slack/etc.

  Let me also move the development info from CLAUDE.md - that should probably go in the README or a separate dev doc. Actually, user said "anything a human might need to see should be in README instead" - so I should include the dev info.

  Wait, they said "minimal" structure. Let me think about what's essential:
  - About (the value prop)
  - Installation
  - Contributing (including dev info? or separate?)

  Maybe:
  - About
  - Installation
  - Contributing
  - Development (for the hive-mind CLI stuff, or link to hive-mind README)

  Actually, they mentioned "we can also add nested README files for more technical information on particular plugins (such as hive-mind)" - so maybe I put the hive-mind CLI dev info in a separate README in the hive-mind plugin folder.

  Let me draft:

  ```markdown
  # alignment-hive

  Shared infrastructure for alignment researchers. Started at MATS, built for the broader AI safety community.


  ```

  I'll focus on crafting a concise, direct README that captures the project's core purpose. The key is to communicate the value proposition quickly and clearly, using a conversational but professional tone. I'll emphasize the collaborative nature of the project and its goal of empowering independent alignment researchers.

  The draft will highlight the main features - the plugin marketplace and hive-mind system - while keeping the language accessible and straightforward. I'll aim to make it inviting for researchers who want to share knowledge and tools across the community.

  Installation instructions will be simple and direct, using code blocks to show exactly how to get started. The contributing section will welcome input and make it clear that collaboration is encouraged.

35|22:17|thinking
  Got it. So the plan is:

  1. **README.md** - Minimal, user-focused:
     - About (value prop, MATS context)
     - Installation
     - Contributing
     - Link to roadmap

  2. **docs/roadmap.md** - Move planning content here (but not hive-mind specific stuff, that stays in hive-mind-plan.md)

  3. **plugins/hive-mind/README.md** - Create this with the dev info from current CLAUDE.md

  4. **CLAUDE.md** - Simplify:
     - Keep project description
     - Add instruction to read hive-mind README when working on it
     - Remove the dev commands (moving to hive-mind README)
     - Remove "Updating the README" section

  Let me draft all of these now.

  - Brief MATS context
  - hive-mind mentioned briefly
  - Installation and contributing sections
  - Link to roadmap

  **docs/roadmap.md** - New file with planning content moved from README

  **plugins/hive-mind/README.md** - New file with dev info (bun commands, pre-commit hook, messages.ts)

  **CLAUDE.md** - Simplified to just point at README and hive-mind README

  Want me to adjust anything?
62|22:25|user
  Nice! Some notes:
  - Rather than "at" MATS, I'd say that MATS are the first customer/intended users/something like that
  - Not just Large AI labs benefit, large orgs/teams in general
  - The project-setup plugin is actually privileged (recommended for almost everyone), as it includes guidance on when to install other plugins
63|22:25|thinking
  The user wants me to update the README with these refinements:
  1. MATS framing - they're the first intended users, not "started at MATS"
  2. Large orgs/teams in general, not just AI labs
  3. project-setup is recommended for almost everyone

  Let me update the README.
64|22:25|tool|Edit|README.md|-20+22
65|22:26|thinking
  Updated the README with all three changes. Let me confirm with the user.
66|22:26|assistant|"Updated. Anything else?"
67|22:27|user|"I think this is great! Are you happy with everything?"
68|22:27|thinking
  The user is asking if I'm happy with the changes. Let me think about whether there's anything I'd suggest improving:

  1. README.md - looks clean and minimal, hits the key points
  2. docs/roadmap.md - it's functional, though quite brief
  3. plugins/hive-mind/README.md - covers the dev essentials
  4. CLAUDE.md - minimal and appropriate

  One thing I notice: the roadmap.md is pretty sparse. But the user wanted minimal, and the hive-mind specific planning is in its own file, so that's probably fine.

  Actually, I'm wondering if the Contributing section could mention how to reach the user on Slack - but they said "Slack DM" which implies people would know who to DM. That's probably fine for the MATS community who knows Yoav.

  I think it's all good. I'll say I'm happy with it.
69|22:27|assistant
  Yes, I think it's good. The README is concise and hits the key points without overselling. The structure is clean:

  - **README.md** - user-facing, minimal
  - **docs/roadmap.md** - general planning (links to hive-mind plan for details)
  - **plugins/hive-mind/README.md** - dev info for contributors
  - **CLAUDE.md** - just pointers for Claude

  One small thing I noticed: `docs/roadmap.md` links to `hive-mind-plan.md` as a relative path, which works. Just wanted to confirm that's intentional (keeps it simple, assumes readers are browsing in the docs folder or on GitHub).
70|22:28|user|"Yeah was a bit weird to me to when I saw it, but I think it's actually fine! Please commit"
