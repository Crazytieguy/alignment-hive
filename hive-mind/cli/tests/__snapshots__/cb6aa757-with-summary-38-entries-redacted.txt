  Fun question! Let me think through this both thematically and practically.

  ## Constraints
  - Plugin names get typed often (`/plugin install X`)
  - Should hint at function without being generic ("memory-plugin" is boring)
  - Bonus if it connects to alignment-hive's bee theme

  ## Top Candidates

  **amber**
  - Amber preserves things for millennia—perfect metaphor for memory
  - Famously preserves insects, including bees (subtle hive connection)
  - Short, warm, evocative
  - `@alignment-hive/amber` reads nicely

  **engram**
  - Neuroscience term for a memory trace—the physical substrate of memory
  - Technical but accessible, signals this is about learning/retention
  - Appeals to the researcher audience
  - `@alignment-hive/engram`

  **nectar**
  - What bees collect and distill into honey
  - Sessions produce raw material → refined into shared knowledge
  - Fits the hive metaphor perfectly
  - `@alignment-hive/nectar`

  **propolis**
  - The resinous mixture bees use to seal and protect the hive
  - Implies curation and protection (human review, privacy-conscious)
  - Harder to spell, more obscure

  **traces**
  - Simple, descriptive, "memory traces"
  - Less distinctive but very clear

  ## My Pick

  **amber** — it's short, memorable, has the preservation metaphor...38words

  Good question! Let me share some thoughts:

  ## Considerations

  1. **Avoid confusion with Claude's "memory"** - Claude has its own context/memory concepts; overlapping terminology could confuse
  2. **Fit the research vibe** - MATS is academic/research-oriented
  3. **Connect to alignment-hive** - the parent project
  4. **Action vs. artifact** - is it about *contributing* or about the *knowledge base* itself?

  ## My Favorites

  **For the system/concept:**
  - **"Field Notes"** - Evocative of researchers capturing observations. Fits the idea of recording learnings from "the field" (Claude Code sessions). Not confused with AI memory.
  - **"Hive Memory"** - Clear connection to alignment-hive, indicates collective storage. Slight overlap with AI memory terminology but the "hive" prefix disambiguates.

  **For the plugin name:**
  - `field-notes` - short, memorable, research-flavored
  - `hive-memory` - explicit tie to parent project

  ## Leaning Toward

  I'd suggest **"field-notes"** for the plugin. Reasons:
  - Fresh terminology (no AI memory confusion)
  - Research-appropriate metaphor
  - Simple two-word compound
  - Action implicit: you're taking notes from your sessions

  The system could still be described as "the memory system" or "shared field notes" in docs....13words
11|01:37|user|"I think I like hive-memory better, though what if we just went with \"hive\" or maybe \"hive-mind\" (is that too on-the-nose?), or something more direct? A detail I've noticed is that when calling slash commands / managing the plugin you generally only see and use the plugin name, not the marketplace name"
12|01:38|thinking|329words
13|01:38|assistant|parent=12
  Good point about plugin name visibility in practice.

  **"hive-mind"** - I actually think the on-the-nose quality is a *feature*. It's:
  - Immediately self-descriptive (collective intelligence)
  - Memorable
  - Slightly playful, which fits a research community
  - "Mind" suggests learning/intelligence, not just storage

  **"hive"** alone feels incomplete - hive of what? Also potentially confusing with the `alignment-hive` marketplace name.

  **More direct alternatives:**
  - `contribute` - action-oriented, clear purpose, but generic
  - `share` - too vague
  - `learn` - could work, implies bidirectional (contribute + retrieve)

  My ranking:
  1. **hive-mind** - memorable, fun, self-explanatory despite being on-the-nose
  2. **learn** - simple, captures both directions (share learnings, retrieve learnings)
  3. **hive-memory** - clear but more serious/literal

  The cheekiness of "hive-mind" might actually be a selling point for MATS scholars. It's the kind of name people remember and talk about.

  What's your gut say?
14|01:40|user|"Ok hive-mind is pretty good yeah. Do you think the marketplace (repo) name is good?"
15|01:40|thinking|253words
16|01:40|assistant|parent=15
  I think **alignment-hive** works well:

  **Pros:**
  - Clear audience signal (alignment researchers know what this means)
  - "Hive" metaphor extends nicely to "hive-mind" - feels cohesive
  - Professional but not boring
  - Memorable

  **Potential concerns:**
  - "Alignment" is niche jargon (but that's the target audience, so fine)
  - Could feel limiting if you expand beyond alignment research later

  **Alternatives to consider:**
  - **safety-hive** - slightly broader (AI safety vs alignment specifically)
  - **mats-hive** - more specific, but locks you to MATS branding
  - **research-hive** - very broad, loses identity

  Honestly, I'd keep it. The name tells you exactly what it is: a hive for the alignment community. And the branding flows naturally:

  ```
  /plugin marketplace add Crazytieguy/alignment-hive
  /plugin install hive-mind@alignment-hive
  ```

  The repetition of "hive" reinforces the metaphor rather than feeling redundant.

  Is there something about it that's nagging at you, or just sanity-checking?
