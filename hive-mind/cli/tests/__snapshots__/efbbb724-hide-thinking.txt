  Alright before we move on with the hive-mind implementation, I'd like to refactor the documentation a bit. We recently made the repo public, and I want it to be in a better state for sharing with the MATS scholars (starts monday). So I want:
  - The readme to explain the intention of the repo better, have better usage guidance, and some basic development guidance
  - Anything in CLAUDE.md that a human might need to see should be in the readme instead
  - The readme shouldn't have planning, that was useful at first but I decided I don't like it now that the repo is public. hive-mind planning is in it's own file, and we can add +24words

  Good idea to clean this up before the Monday launch. Let me ask some questions:

  **Audience & Tone**
  1. What's the technical level of MATS scholars? Should the README assume familiarity with Claude Code, or explain basics?
  2. Tone preference - casual/friendly, professional, or somewhere in between?

  **Content - Intention/Vision**
  3. How would you describe the core "why" of this repo in a sentence or two? What problem does it solve for scholars?
  4. Should there be any mention of the broader vision (shared learnings across cohorts, community-built tooling, etc.)?

  **Usage Guidance**
  5. The current installation section shows marketplace commands. Is that the primary way scholars will use this, or will some clone/fork directly?
  6. What's +93words

  Done. Here's what changed:

  **README.md** - Rewritten with:
  - Value prop about leveling the playing field for independent researchers
  - Brief MATS context
  - hive-mind mentioned briefly
  - Installation and contributing sections
  - Link to roadmap

  **docs/roadmap.md** - New file with planning content moved from README

  **plugins/hive-mind/README.md** - New file with dev info (bun commands, pre-commit hook, messages.ts)

  **CLAUDE.md** - Simplified to just point at README and hive-mind README

  Want me to adjust anything?
62|22:25|user
  Nice! Some notes:
  - Rather than "at" MATS, I'd say that MATS are the first customer/intended users/something like that
  - Not just Large AI labs benefit, large orgs/teams in general
  - The project-setup plugin is actually privileged (recommended for almost everyone), as it includes guidance on when to install other plugins

  Yes, I think it's good. The README is concise and hits the key points without overselling. The structure is clean:

  - **README.md** - user-facing, minimal
  - **docs/roadmap.md** - general planning (links to hive-mind plan for details)
  - **plugins/hive-mind/README.md** - dev info for contributors
  - **CLAUDE.md** - just pointers for Claude

  One small thing I noticed: `docs/roadmap.md` links to `hive-mind-plan.md` as a relative path, which works. Just wanted to confirm that's intentional (keeps it simple, assumes readers are browsing in the docs folder or on GitHub).
