Claude Code infrastructure for AI safety researchers.

## About This Repo

This is early-stage infrastructure. @README.md serves as the living plan document - it captures current priorities, next steps, and design decisions as they evolve.

## Updating the README

- Keep "Immediate Next Steps" current: move completed items out, add new ones as they emerge
- Update design notes as decisions are made or changed
- Add new sections as the project grows, but keep it scannable
- The README is the source of truth for "what are we doing next" - treat it as a working document, not a polished artifact
